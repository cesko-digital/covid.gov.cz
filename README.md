## Getting started 

### Frontend - Gatsby

  

If you only want to run frontend part of this app, you **dont have to install Docker** and the backend part. It works standalone as well - see the frontend  for more details

- 🚀 [see how to get up and running with the frontend](/gatsby/README.md#gatsby) ➡️ 
  

### Backend - Drupal

We're using docker containers from `docker` folder:

-  `cd docker`

Copy and modify env file as needed

-  `cp .env.example .env`

Start containers

-  `docker-compose up -d`

Install dependencies

-  `docker-compose exec drupal composer install` 

Install Drupal with existing config, database connection is already injected in settings.php file

- `docker-compose exec drupal drush si --existing-config -y`

Access site on `http://localhost:1577` if you didn't change

`COVID_PORT_NGINX` variable in your `env` file

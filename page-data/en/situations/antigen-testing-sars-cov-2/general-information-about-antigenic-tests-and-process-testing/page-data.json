These so-called \"rapid antigen tests\" reveal patients at the peak of the infection, when the body has the highest concentration of these proteins. It is as such that the highest risk of transmitting the infection to other people. Compared to RT-PCR tests, the <strong>advantage is lower demands on the expertise</strong> of medical staff in sampling, the possibility of <strong>evaluating the test directly on the site</strong> and the speed of this evaluation (time from sampling to the result does not exceed 30 minutes) and it is 10 times cheaper. On the contrary, the disadvantage is that they are not as sensitive as the standard RT-PCR tests used to accurately identify those infected according to the algorithm of the Ministry of Health.</p>\n<h2><strong>Test process</strong></h2>\n<p>They identify you upon arrival, have an OP or CP with you. You will receive an e-Request, it will take up to 3-5 minutes for the healthcare professional to handle this administration. Collection will take approx. 1-2 min. for the test taker, the collection itself is the same as for PCR tests, i.e. swab the nasal cavity with a special stick. Execution, evaluation and registration of the test result takes 15 - 35 minutes. In total, the <strong>test taker waits on the spot for the test result within an hour.</strong></p>\n<p>The Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic has also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aEHOflXB2k&amp;feature=emb_logo\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">prepared a short instructional video</a>, so <strong>you can see what will happen</strong>. </p>\n<p>There is also an instructional <strong>video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhX-AwbV2NQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">general practitioners and specialists</a> who would like to participate at the Covid-19 testing points.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Test safety and reliability</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Tests are not dangerous</strong> if they are performed only by trained health professionals. Therefore, each sampling point must be registered and healthcare professionals trained. We understand that nasopharyngeal swab is not a pleasant thing. Therefore, follow the doctor's instructions to ensure that the collection is successful and at the same time it will be at least uncomfortable for you.</p>\n<p>Calculations of the so-called <strong>specificity and sensitivity</strong> are used to determine the reliability and error rate of antigen tests.</p>\n<p>Sensitivity is measured by the ratio of those tested positive by the antigen test to all those infected (including people whose tests are negative, even if the reference RT-PCR test tested positive). According to information from the press conference 26.11. 2020 (State Institute of Public Health - Ostrava), antigenic tests imported into the Czech Republic have a sensitivity ranging from 81% to 98%. <strong>This means that a negative result from antigen testing does not necessarily mean that you are not infected with the same reliability as a PCR test.</strong></p>\n<p>Specificity is measured by the ratio of those tested negative to the antigen test against all uninfected (including people who tested positive for the antigen test, even if the reference RT-PCR test was negative). Antigenic assays generally have a high degree of specificity. <strong>This means that a person who has tested positive for an antigen is most likely to be infected.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Can the testing be declined by a practitioner?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. The testing is not carried out if the person supposed to be tested was isolated due to COVID-19 (at least for a minimal time span as stated in the current version of the Ministry of Health extraordinary measure regarding antigenic testing) <strong>and </strong>his/her first positive RT-PCR test result is less than 90 days ago. A <strong>fresh (max. 3 days ago) negative RT-PCR test result also poses a reason to decline an antigene testing. </strong></p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/general-information-about-antigenic-tests-and-process-testing"},"changed":"2021-02-02T17:54:14+00:00","valid_from":"2020-12-08T00:50:23+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-12-10T23:22:20+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/N%C3%A1vod-na-pou%C5%BE%C3%ADv%C3%A1n%C3%AD-a-interpretace-v%C3%BDsledk%C5%AF-antigenn%C3%ADho-testu-pro-detekci-viru-SARS-CoV-2-covid-19-ve-v%C3%BDt%C4%9Bru-z-nosohlatnu.pdf","title":"NÁVOD NA POUŽÍVÁNÍ ANTIGENNÍHO TESTU PRO DETEKCI VIRU SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) VE VÝTĚRU Z NOSOHLATNU"},{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Algoritmus-a-interpretace-antigenn%C3%ADho-testu-v-detekci-nemoci-covid-pro-l%C3%A9ka%C5%99e-od-2.11.2020.pdf","title":"Algoritmus použití a interpretace antigenního testu v detekci nemoci COVID-19 pro dobrovolné testování pedagogických pracovníků"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mimo%C5%99%C3%A1dn%C3%A9-opat%C5%99en%C3%AD-povinnost-hl%C3%A1sit-v%C3%BDsledky-z-POC-AG-do-ISIN-s-%C3%BA%C4%8Dinnost%C3%AD-od-1.-1.-2021.pdf","title":" Extraordinary measures for the obligation to report the results of POC antigen tests to IDIS."}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":{"code":"info_outline"},"situation_type":{"name":"Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"grading"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Interpretation of the antigen test result, how to behave after receiving the Ag test result","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/interpretation-antigen-test-result-how-behave-after-receiving","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Information on the comprehensive testing by antigen tests","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/information-comprehensive-testing-antigen-tests","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Antigen testing in social care facilities","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/antigen-testing-social-care-facilities","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Problems and failures that can occur when testing Ag tests","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/problems-and-failures-can-occur-when-testing-ag-tests","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Where can I undergo an antigene test?","value":"The testing points network should stay preserved - the antigene testing will therefore take place at the same testing points as PCR testings do. For a list of the testing points (in Czech only) please see https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/seznam-odberovych-center/ . The scheduled patient density should amount to 20 - 30 per testing point per hour. The total countrywide testing capacity has been scheduled to 30,000 - 40,000 tests per day.\r\n\r\nAlso a third testing point network is in the making. That should support the accessibilty of testings on regional level. GPs' as well as specialised physicians' and stomatologists' practices will build this network, provided the physicians are involved in the Czech public health insurance system. The testing points shall as such be reserved for patients registered at the respective practice. Within this network, the final decision about whether an antigene test will be carried out or not relies on the physician, the patient is, therefore, not entitled to undergo such a test. Should a physician decide to register his practice as a generally accessible testing point (i.e. to allow patients outside his/her registered patients' pool to undergo an antigene test) as well, an appointment booking option shall be established for those patients. There have been hundreds of such practices registered already."},{"question":"When have I to undergo a test?","value":"Should you be showing symptoms of COVID-19, your GP, or - as part of contact tracing measures regarding those infected - your regional public health office will issue an e-referral (in Czech: e-žádanka) to a testing point, most probably, however, demanding a PCR test.\r\nShouldn't you show any symptoms, the testing is optional for you and all you need is to book an appointment at your desired testing point. "},{"question":"How do I prove having undergone an antigene test?","value":"The testing facility will issue a document containing the date and result of the test, and hand it over to you on the spot. You will be as well told how you are to behave according to the test result. The document can look like a referral in paper form or the facility can use its own document template."},{"question":"Can I decline my participation at the testing?","value":"As for the countrywide preventive antigene testing, yes. Should you have got an e-referral issued (by your GP when showing symptoms, or by your regional public health office when having been traced), you have to come to the testing point - in that case, an PCR test (and not an antigene one) will be carried out."},{"question":"","value":"The antigene testing is not carried out "},{"question":"Must the antigen tests be paid for?","value":"No, these are paid by your insurer."},{"question":"How will the respective testing points be supplied with the testing sets? ","value":"The testing sets will be bought by the practices and the testing service paid by the insurers."},{"question":"Do I need to book an appointment in order to undergo an antigene test?","value":"Yes. Teachers are allowed to book their appointments from December 4 onwards. As for others, the booking system will be made accessible before the countrywide testing action begins. "},{"question":"Do I have to await the result of my antigene test on the spot? Couldn't I just receive a text message?","value":"No, the result indeed has to be handed out to the patient on the spot. Antigene tests are used exactly in order to fast reveal those infected within a population and to isolate them. Please allow that hour of your time and take a book, something regarding your business, or, for instance, your crochet work with you. The Central Coordination Task Force simply doesn't recommend the testing points to present antigene test results via SMS."},{"question":"Can I change the date/time of an appointment I booked previously?","value":"Yes, but you must delete your booking and then create a new one, in order not to occupy the time slots.  "},{"question":"Do I have to register to the Reservatio booking system when booking an appointment for a test?","value":"No, the registration is optional - you can book your appointment without it as well."}],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-02-02T19:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"grading"},"situation":[{"id":"11922fb6-3c34-5667-8084-dd8d1bfa38eb","title":"General information about antigenic tests and the process of testing","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/general-information-about-antigenic-tests-and-process-testing"}},{"id":"4be37681-ba6a-5f07-9e8e-f8c58fcdd56c","title":"Interpretation of the antigen test result, how to behave after receiving the Ag test result","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/interpretation-antigen-test-result-how-behave-after-receiving"}},{"id":"0600c821-5734-54fb-977b-948856aab038","title":"Information on the comprehensive testing by antigen tests","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/information-comprehensive-testing-antigen-tests"}},{"id":"cf6e266a-c020-5f70-b2bb-a677df66257f","title":"Antigen testing in social care facilities","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/antigen-testing-social-care-facilities"}},{"id":"191811d8-0f60-570c-bb1c-49eae142cc12","title":"Problems and failures that can occur when testing Ag tests","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/problems-and-failures-can-occur-when-testing-ag-tests"}},{"id":"5572e552-24fc-5d21-9553-12a24208d2d9","title":"Antigen testing for employees ","path":{"alias":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/antigen-testing-employees"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/general-information-about-antigenic-tests-and-process-testing","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/antigenni-testovani/obecne-informace-o-antigennich-testech-popis-provedeni-testu"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

However, the law that responds to the effects of the epidemic on legal persons has been passed. In practice, there may be situations where a member meeting of the association needs to decide on a certain issue, but it is not possible to meet. For these cases, the law defines the rules for taking decisions for the duration of the extraordinary measures, even if this is not enshrined in the articles of the association. This law is valid only till December 31, 2020.</p>\n<p>Specifically, there is a possibility of using technical means (e.g. teleconferencing) or correspondence voting (i.e. by mail or email). The option applies in general to any legal entity, i.e. e.g. s. R. O., A. S., Cooperatives, associations or e.g. SVJ.</p>\n<p>The law also regulates a situation when a member of a body of a legal entity ends his term of office and it is not possible to agree on the extension or renewal of his office. In such cases, the term of office of a member of the institution shall be automatically extended or renewed, even without the obligation of the competent authority. In case of disagreement with the extension of the term of office, it will be possible to solve this problem by so-called co-option. That is, the current members of the body will be able to elect a new member of the body, even if the charter does not allow it.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/general-or-holding-meetings"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":"2020-04-24T00:00:00+02:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T16:51:09+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2020-191","title":"Legal regulation"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"how_to_vote"},"situation_type":{"name":"Business activities","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"business"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Membership meetings","path":{"alias":"/situations/club-activities/membership-meetings","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":"2020-12-31T23:59:59+01:00","last_updated":"2020-11-06T16:07:38+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Business activities","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"business"},"situation":[{"id":"5d66d9f1-466d-59d2-a4bd-3dc1862c7fc2","title":"Penalties - Business","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/penalties-business"}},{"id":"0c5fb784-d7ee-5b9d-8022-9d8be404a349","title":"Impossibility to repay a loan or a mortgage - business","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/impossibility-repay-loan-or-mortgage-business"}},{"id":"ff15124e-1dbf-587e-a24e-d6b963b8ef29","title":"Working with a client","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/working-client"}},{"id":"16682d64-1df7-5bdd-8d9a-1bf06116f001","title":"Home office - business","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/home-office-business"}},{"id":"7536dad1-78d0-53d3-8c91-34cb212b9e27","title":"Agriculture ","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/agriculture"}},{"id":"e7d2b9e9-43cc-50cb-9644-2d8e9502c262","title":"Hygiene products at the workplace","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/hygiene-products-workplace"}},{"id":"aaa01096-f974-5bfe-81f5-95ca61ff53f0","title":"Industry","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/industry"}},{"id":"68af21d6-54ff-5ad4-91ea-4e0040286ee0","title":"Sheltered workshop","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/sheltered-workshop"}},{"id":"910f0d34-7abb-5994-b6a3-fe7b99815ff1","title":"Dealing with official matters - business","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/dealing-official-matters-business"}},{"id":"9f504c1a-5174-5795-b6ad-3e306c110ad9","title":"Compensation - business","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/compensation-business"}},{"id":"87971d4b-27a9-5f62-a019-ba657f199050","title":"Trainings - business","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/trainings-business"}},{"id":"ce43edf8-4cf9-58bc-9fe3-2e3b9bab815f","title":"General or holding meetings ","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/general-or-holding-meetings"}},{"id":"687f5a27-2c0b-5efa-9fd0-cd599c7917ff","title":"Data boxes","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/data-boxes"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/business-activities/general-or-holding-meetings","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/business-activities","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/podnikatelska-cinnost/konani-valnych-hromad-clenskych-schuzi"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

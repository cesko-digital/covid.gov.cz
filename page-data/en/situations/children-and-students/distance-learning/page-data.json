In the case of compulsory school attendance, the child must be <strong>excused within 3 working days</strong>. When distance learning is in place follow the instructions you receive from teachers and the school. Especially at higher levels of education please follow the website and instructions given by the study department.</p>\n<p>Distance learning depends on the possibility of remote connection. <strong>If you do not have the necessary equipment to complete this type of teaching</strong>, <strong>contact the school</strong> and ask for help. They should be ready to assist you in these types of situations, and if their supplies are limited, they will advise you to get help you need in a different place. For example, non-profit organizations can also help you with your difficulties.</p>\n<p>At present we are dealing with a number of new challenges, including distance learning. For both teachers and pupils and their parents, <strong>distance education is usually something new to them</strong> and they need time to adjust. Therefore, please be helpful and understand the needs of each other. <strong>We do not replace full-time teaching</strong>, but you can also learn a lot online.</p>\n<p>To successfully manage distance learning, we recommend <strong>setting up a schedule</strong>: Get up at a regular hour. Create a workspace. Do not go to bed to connect to your lessons. Schedule your tasks and responsibilities. Make notes, it will help you keep attention. Communicate with teachers and classmates. Don't be afraid to ask at any time.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/distance-learning"},"changed":"2020-11-24T22:48:44+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-08T18:46:19+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://nadalku.msmt.cz/cs/rodice","title":"Tips and tricks for distance learning for parents"},{"uri":"https://koronavirus.edu.cz","title":"More information on education"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"school"},"situation_type":{"name":"Children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"school"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Primary schools","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/primary-schools","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Secondary schools","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/secondary-schools","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"High schools","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/high-schools","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Higher Vocational Schools","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/higher-vocational-schools","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Vocational schools","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/vocational-schools","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Universities","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/universities","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Psychological help for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/psychological-help-children-and-students","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-18T00:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"school"},"situation":[{"id":"ecb1e6f2-97b5-50e5-9d5a-24a8422aaa84","title":"Psychological help for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/psychological-help-children-and-students"}},{"id":"bc16fb19-e656-5496-a5b6-33278ed63964","title":"The return home","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/return-home"}},{"id":"14e5f8fc-8c39-58fa-be0e-bab4b040c684","title":"Halls of residence","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/halls-residence"}},{"id":"34cf14b8-ade0-5b7a-b9de-ad1529a3d10b","title":"Meeting friends","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/meeting-friends"}},{"id":"6326326d-22f3-579c-bfe3-0820ea5e31a8","title":"Distance learning","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/distance-learning"}},{"id":"3c69cd17-ffb1-51a6-9af6-ed41ca3423a1","title":"Divorced families","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/divorced-families"}},{"id":"0ce77e9c-2214-59b0-9e56-285298b053cb","title":"Work-agreements and self-employed","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/work-agreements-and-self-employed"}},{"id":"5e090aa3-7ea0-546f-a50b-6c8096125570","title":"Hygiene recommendations for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/hygiene-recommendations-children-and-students"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/children-and-students/distance-learning","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/children-and-students","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/deti-studenti/distancni-vyuka"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

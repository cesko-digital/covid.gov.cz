Travel to transfer or take over children is one of the exceptions to restrictions on the movement of persons. An exception is also granted for necessary travel to family or close persons.</p>\n<p>From a legal point of view, therefore, there is no reason not to comply with the court's decision concerning children.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is necessary to consider all the risks and try to create rules that reduce the possibility of disease transmission. Especially if the risk of infection is higher for one of the parents (such as health professionals or other people who are in contact with the sick or more people). However, such adjustments to the regime should be based on the agreement of both parents.</p>\n<p>We recommend maintaining contact with the child through telephone calls, video calls, and other tools that allow at least alternative contact if quarantine or other measures do not allow personal contact.</p>\n<p>A change in alternating care is also strongly recommended in case when one of the parents finds themself in isolation or quarantine. In this case, the transfer of the child should not take place. If the child is in the care of a parent who has to start quarantine for some reason, the child should remain in quarantine with that parent. If, on the other hand, the child is currently in the care of one parent and should transfer to a parent who has to start or is in quarantine as part of alternating care, we recommend that this transfer not take place.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/divorced-families"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-08T19:04:56+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"school"},"situation_type":{"name":"Children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"school"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Psychological help for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/psychological-help-children-and-students","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Measures on free movement","path":{"alias":"/situations/free-movement-people/measures-free-movement","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Keeping in touch with family","path":{"alias":"/situations/seniors/keeping-touch-family","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Christmas family gathering","path":{"alias":"/situations/current-events-christmas/christmas-family-gathering","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":null},"situationArea":{"name":"Children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"school"},"situation":[{"id":"ecb1e6f2-97b5-50e5-9d5a-24a8422aaa84","title":"Psychological help for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/psychological-help-children-and-students"}},{"id":"bc16fb19-e656-5496-a5b6-33278ed63964","title":"The return home","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/return-home"}},{"id":"14e5f8fc-8c39-58fa-be0e-bab4b040c684","title":"Halls of residence","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/halls-residence"}},{"id":"34cf14b8-ade0-5b7a-b9de-ad1529a3d10b","title":"Meeting friends","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/meeting-friends"}},{"id":"6326326d-22f3-579c-bfe3-0820ea5e31a8","title":"Distance learning","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/distance-learning"}},{"id":"3c69cd17-ffb1-51a6-9af6-ed41ca3423a1","title":"Divorced families","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/divorced-families"}},{"id":"0ce77e9c-2214-59b0-9e56-285298b053cb","title":"Work-agreements and self-employed","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/work-agreements-and-self-employed"}},{"id":"5e090aa3-7ea0-546f-a50b-6c8096125570","title":"Hygiene recommendations for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/hygiene-recommendations-children-and-students"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/children-and-students/divorced-families","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/children-and-students","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/deti-studenti/rozvedene-rodiny"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4260621986","4279535114"]}

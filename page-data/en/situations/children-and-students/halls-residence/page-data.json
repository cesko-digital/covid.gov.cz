This also applies to the university students.</p>\n<p>There are some <strong>exemptions</strong>. Students of the same class and practical training can stay at the school accommodation facilities. The exemption also applies to all students of medicine and education with <strong>practical training</strong>, and to students with an <strong>obligation to work</strong>.</p>\n<p>Dormitories and halls of residence can be used by PhD students.</p>\n<p><strong>My residential address is at a dormitory/hall</strong></p>\n<p>Students who <strong>do not have another residential address within the grounds of the Czech Republic</strong> may remain in dormitories/halls of residence. The residential address is a place which is considered to be your permanent place to live, <strong>a place where it feels like home to you</strong>. If you provide a consent in which you state the dormitory/hall of residence, not any other place, is a home to you, you may remain living there.</p>\n<p>If you stay in a dormitory/hall of residence, <strong>p</strong><strong>lease </strong><strong>maintain increased hygiene measures</strong> (the rule of 3: face mask – hands – social distancing).</p>\n<p>However, the Ministry of Education is asking, if possible, for <strong>students to return home </strong>and thus reducing their social contacts. <strong>Universities decide on the details of the operation of the dormitories independently</strong>.

This applies also to university students.</p>\n<p>There are some <strong>exceptions</strong>. Students staying in a residence for a purpose of presence or distance education can be accommodated in a residence. A valid exception is also granted for students attending the practical training, <strong>medics</strong>, and <strong>students of pedagogical fields</strong> or students ordered with <strong>on-call duty</strong>.</p>\n<p>Stay in a residence is also permitted for PhD students attending presence education.</p>\n<h2><strong>I live in a hall of residence</strong></h2>\n<p>As a student with <strong>no other residence (place to stay, home) you have also the right to stay in a residence or dormitory</strong>. The residence (not a hall of residence) is a place where you permanently live and feel at home. If you are able to prove that you feel home at the hall of residence, you may stay there.</p>\n<p><strong>Please pay increased attention to hygiene</strong> if staying in a residence – face mask, hand sanitation, social distancing.</p>\n<p>Ministry of Education is asking<strong>, if possible, students to return home</strong> and reduce their social contacts. <strong>Universities define their own set of rules about operation of halls of residences</strong>. Thus, in case of any question, <strong>please contact the hall of residence directly</strong> via phone or e-mail.</p>\n<p>If you are in a <strong>difficult social situation</strong> related to any of mentioned measure, do not hesitate to ask your institution (school, college, university) for help. You may be provided with scholarship intended for students in need. <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/mop\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Financial help is also offered by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs</a>.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/halls-residence"},"changed":"2021-02-06T09:13:36+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-02T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-08T18:24:12+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":{"code":"school"},"situation_type":{"name":"Children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"school"}}},"measures":[{"title":"Restrictions defining the operation of university dormitories","path":{"alias":"/measures/education/restrictions-defining-operation-university-dormitories","langcode":"en"},"valid_from":"2021-02-27T00:00:00+01:00","valid_to":"2021-03-21T23:59:59+01:00","relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}]}}],"related_situations":[{"title":"The return home","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/return-home","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-01-03T09:29:58+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"school"},"situation":[{"id":"ecb1e6f2-97b5-50e5-9d5a-24a8422aaa84","title":"Psychological help for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/psychological-help-children-and-students"}},{"id":"bc16fb19-e656-5496-a5b6-33278ed63964","title":"The return home","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/return-home"}},{"id":"14e5f8fc-8c39-58fa-be0e-bab4b040c684","title":"Halls of residence","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/halls-residence"}},{"id":"34cf14b8-ade0-5b7a-b9de-ad1529a3d10b","title":"Meeting friends","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/meeting-friends"}},{"id":"6326326d-22f3-579c-bfe3-0820ea5e31a8","title":"Distance learning","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/distance-learning"}},{"id":"3c69cd17-ffb1-51a6-9af6-ed41ca3423a1","title":"Divorced families","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/divorced-families"}},{"id":"0ce77e9c-2214-59b0-9e56-285298b053cb","title":"Work-agreements and self-employed","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/work-agreements-and-self-employed"}},{"id":"5e090aa3-7ea0-546f-a50b-6c8096125570","title":"Hygiene recommendations for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/hygiene-recommendations-children-and-students"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/children-and-students/halls-residence","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/children-and-students","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/deti-studenti/koleje"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

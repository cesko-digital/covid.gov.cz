Follow strict hygiene rules when eating.

If your university does not reduce the dormitory fees and you find yourself in a difficult situation, you can apply for a social scholarship. You can also apply for financial support under the state social support system of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which can give you, for example, a one-time benefit of emergency immediate assistance.

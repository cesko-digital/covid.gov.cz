Students currently resident in the Czech republic without valid exception reason have to return home.</p>\n<p>If you are going home to your family, you can use the option of Covid- 19 testing without delay by one of the mobile testing teams. Please wait for the results of your test in isolation to prevent possible contact of your loved ones with someone Covid-positive.</p>\n<p>If the result of your test is positive, it would be best to wait for your quarantine out in your dormitory room.

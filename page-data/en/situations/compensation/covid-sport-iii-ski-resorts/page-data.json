See the details bellow. ","content":{"processed":"<p>The Ministry of Industry and Trade has prepared a compensation program for ski resorts with regards to their seasonal opening regime i.e. they can only be open a few weeks / months a year. The support will be provided as a subsidy for operating costs such as energy costs, rents, depreciation of operating equipment, overheads and more. The approved aid respects the temporary framework of the European Commission according to which subsidies of up to 800,000 EUR can currently be provided in connection with the coronavirus COVID-19 disease. The Ministry of Industry and Trade will notify the program to the European Commission.</p>\n<p>An allocation of 1 billion CZK will be set aside for the implementation of the program. The expected drawdown is around 750 mil.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose / conditions:</strong> The aim is to mitigate the negative effects of restrictions associated with measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide support to those entrepreneurs who were directly restricted since December 27, 2020 on the basis of crisis measures in the form of operation and management of ski resorts, which led to a significant decrease in sales and thus the liquidity of these businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum amount of support: </strong>The maximum amount of support per beneficiary depends on the number and structure of transport facilities, where 1 place includes compensation of 210 CZK for basic lifts, 340 CZK for non-detachable chairlifts or 530 CZK for detachable chairlifts per day. The highest possible daily allowance is further determined by the amount calculated as 50% of the current average daily cost of operation for the past 3 seasons. The beneficiaries are entitled to the lower of the amounts calculated per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Decisive period:</strong> December 27, 2020 - January 22, 2021</p>\n<p><strong>Receipt of applications:</strong> from February 15, 2021 from 9 AM - March 18</p>\n<p><strong>Method of submission: </strong>Through the information system accessible from the <a href=\"https://aisportal.mpo.cz/AISPortal/default\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">AIS MIT Portal</a>.

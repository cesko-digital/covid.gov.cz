The date of the start of the call will be specified. Take a look at the details.","content":{"processed":"<p>The Ministry of Industry and Trade has prepared a compensation program for ski resorts with regards to their seasonal opening regime i.e. they can only be open a few weeks / months a year. The support will be provided as a subsidy for operating costs such as energy costs, rents, depreciation of operating equipment, overheads and more. The approved aid respects the temporary framework of the European Commission according to which subsidies of up to 800,000 EUR can currently be provided in connection with the coronavirus COVID-19 disease. The Ministry of Industry and Trade will notify the program to the European Commission.</p>\n<p>An allocation of 1 billion CZK will be set aside for the implementation of the program. The expected drawdown is around 750 mil.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose / conditions:</strong> The aim is to mitigate the negative effects of restrictions associated with measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide support to those entrepreneurs who were directly restricted since December 27, 2020 on the basis of crisis measures in the form of operation and management of ski resorts, which led to a significant decrease in sales and thus the liquidity of these businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum amount of support: </strong>The maximum amount of support per beneficiary depends on the number and structure of transport facilities, where 1 place includes compensation of 210 CZK for basic lifts, 340 CZK for non-detachable chairlifts or 530 CZK for detachable chairlifts per day. The highest possible daily allowance is further determined by the amount calculated as 50% of the current average daily cost of operation for the past 3 seasons. The beneficiaries are entitled to the lower of the amounts calculated per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Decisive period:</strong> December 27, 2020 - January 22, 2021</p>\n<p><strong>Receipt of applications:</strong> 1st call is being prepared, it should be published during January</p>\n<p><strong>Submitting method for the application</strong>: It will be possible to submit applications via the MIT information system available via the website <a href=\"http://www.mpo.cz\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">www.mpo.cz</a>, to which entrepreneurs are already accustomed from previous COVID programs, an information system accessible from the <a href=\"https://aisportal.mpo.cz/AISPortal/default\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">MIT AIS Portal</a> (only in czech).</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Industry and Trade is working on a plan to offer wider support to all sports facilities in the future. The sports ground should thus strive to obtain operational guarantees for loans from CMZRB.</p>\n<p>We will notify you as soon as more information will be available, such as the exact start date of the call.<br />\n </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/covid-sport-iii-ski-resorts"},"changed":"2021-02-07T14:01:57+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-07T14:01:57+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mpo.cz/cz/rozcestnik/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/vlada-schvalila-podporu-pro-uzavrena-lyzarska-strediska--258863/","title":"Informace o COVID – SPORT III Lyžařská střediska na MPO.cz"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Compensation","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"money"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-01-17T00:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Compensation","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"money"},"situation":[{"id":"1001024b-b1fc-5a42-a878-628f29122899","title":"Caregiver’s allowance for self-employed II (October call closed)","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/caregivers-allowance-self-employed-ii-october-call-closed"}},{"id":"9ffc8369-0fb9-5630-8a30-8e7bbb64aff4","title":"Caregiver’s allowance for full-time employees/people with work agreements","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/caregivers-allowance-full-time-employeespeople-work-agreements"}},{"id":"8b87f234-3fa7-5265-a477-837e8b8c37be","title":"Compensation bonus","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/compensation-bonus"}},{"id":"55634cda-336a-5a96-b953-f79d4a54eac5","title":"COVID-Culture II","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/covid-culture-ii"}},{"id":"303daa7c-9ada-53b5-8a6d-531f44d9bba5","title":"COVID-Tourism ","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/covid-tourism"}},{"id":"619931e6-4071-539e-8ee9-cab046c65cab","title":"COVID-Rent II","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/covid-rent-ii"}},{"id":"5d98e030-c12c-5572-8d7e-9e33a4b7e5df","title":"Expired program: COVID-Bus","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/expired-program-covid-bus"}},{"id":"c3d5a886-9621-5224-a0ba-49c49a66f150","title":"Expired program: COVID-Sport II","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/expired-program-covid-sport-ii"}},{"id":"8a66d2c6-8eb4-599e-b693-cbfaa934c9e2","title":"A large tax liberation package","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/large-tax-liberation-package"}},{"id":"bc8ead4f-41c8-5ead-860e-b2b7b89a7c7b","title":"EET postponement","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/eet-postponement"}},{"id":"d53d6599-059f-5388-9b44-d774c2413073","title":"Antivirus A, A Plus -

","content":{"processed":"<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<p>It is best to contact a specific loan provider. <strong>The activities of banking and non-banking providers are not directly limited</strong> by government measures. They can therefore continue to function, so contact the institution you need directly. If you decide to go to one of their branches, we recommend that you <strong>check the opening hours of the particular branch in advance</strong>. It may have been modified in connection with Covid-19. However, please only sort out <strong>urgent matters</strong> and <strong>prioritise online communication</strong>.</p>\n<p>Currently, banks and non-bank lenders allow <strong>individual solutions</strong> for your specific case. Most banks have clear forms on their websites for this purpose. <strong>If the bank does not respond to you</strong>, you always have the opportunity to have your request checked with the banks ombudsman. In these cases, clients of non-bank companies can contact the Czech Leasing and Financial Association or the Association of Non-Bank Lenders.</p>\n<p><strong>Another option</strong> is to contact the Financial Arbiter. And if you still have financial difficulties, contact Financial Distress Counseling</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/impossibility-repay-loan-or-mortgage-citizen"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-06T16:56:19+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.financnitisen.cz/","title":"Contact the Financial Distress Counselling"},{"uri":"https://finarbitr.cz/cs/","title":"Financial arbiter"},{"uri":"https://www.clfa.cz/","title":"Czech Leasing and Finance Association"},{"uri":"http://www.apnu.cz/","title":"Association of Non-Bank Lenders"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Compensation","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"money"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Impossibility to repay a loan or a mortgage -

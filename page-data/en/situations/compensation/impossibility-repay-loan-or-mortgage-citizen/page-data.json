They can therefore continue to function, so contact the institution you need directly. If you decide to go to one of their branches, we recommend that you <strong>check the opening hours of the particular branch in advance</strong>. It may have been modified in connection with Covid-19. However, please only sort out <strong>urgent matters</strong> and <strong>prioritise online communication</strong>.</p>\n<p>Currently, banks and non-bank lenders allow <strong>individual solutions</strong> for your specific case. Most banks have clear forms on their websites for this purpose. <strong>If the bank does not respond to you</strong>, you always have the opportunity to have your request checked with the banks ombudsman. In these cases, clients of non-bank companies can contact the Czech Leasing and Financial Association or the Association of Non-Bank Lenders.</p>\n<p><strong>Another option</strong> is to contact the Financial Arbiter.

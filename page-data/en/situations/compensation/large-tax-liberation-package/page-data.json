You can send it by email.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Institute for retrospective application of tax loss.</strong></p>\n<p>If the taxpayer already expects a tax loss for the tax period of 2020, he will be able to reduce his tax base retroactively for the tax period of 2019, and the tax office will pay him the funds as a matter of priority.</p>\n<p><strong>3) General waiver of the administrative fee for submitting applications to the tax or customs office.</strong></p>\n<p>The all-over waiver of the administrative fee for submitting applications to the tax or customs office includes the following situations:</p>\n<ul><li>remission of interest on arrears</li>\n<li>remission of interest on a deferred amount</li>\n<li>waiver of a fine for failure to submit an inspection report</li>\n<li>refund of taxes on importation and remission of customs arrears</li>\n<li>confirmation of non-existence of arrears</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>4) Widespread exemption of VAT on gratuitous supplies of necessary protective equipment, for which the obligation to declare tax arise in the period from October to December.</strong></p>\n<p>The all-over VAT waiver for the gratuitous supply of necessary protective equipment, for which the obligation to declare tax arise in the period from October to December, covers the following situations:</p>\n<ul><li>free delivery of goods (protective equipment, test kits, etc.)</li>\n<li>free delivery of goods for the production of disinfection</li>\n<li>free delivery of goods to healthcare professionals</li>\n<li>free delivery of goods to the components of the integrated rescue system, the Czech Army, or for the needs of social services</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>5) Taking into account the individual's difficult situation.</strong></p>\n<p>If necessary, it is, of course, possible to use the most common individual tools to take into account the difficult situation of tax subjects.

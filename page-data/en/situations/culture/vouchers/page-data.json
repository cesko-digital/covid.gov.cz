The organizer's <strong>right to postpone any refunds</strong> for purchased tickets, and the customer's right to apply for a refund voucher issued by the organizer of the event is stated by a <a href=\"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2020-247\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Special law</a>.</p>\n<p>This only applies to events that are expected to take place by 30/09/2021. If an event is cancelled, the organizer will make a public announcement by which the organizer's \"protection period\" begins. After this period ends, the organizer has an obligation to issue a refund for any purchased tickets.</p>\n<p>The customer has a right to apply for a compensation voucher by 31/03/2021. This voucher is to be issued by the organizer of the event and the minimum value of this voucher equals the price of the previously purchased ticket(s). Within the following 6 months since the compensation voucher had been issued, the organizer will offer a compensatory event to the voucher holder. The organizer has no right to request any additional payments from the customer (voucher holder).</p>\n<p>If the organizer <strong>fails to issue a compensation voucher within a month</strong> since the customer had applied for this voucher, the organizer's right to postpone a refund becomes invalid. The customer has now right to request a full refund for the purchased ticket(s). The refund needs to be issued <strong>within the following 14 days</strong>. The same rule applies if the organizer <strong>fails to offer a compensatory event within 6 months</strong> since the compensation voucher had been issued. The organizer of the event has an obligation to issue a refund <strong>within the following 14 days.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If the customer </strong>is a person with a disability (a \"ZTP card\" holder), a job seeker, a pregnant woman, a person on maternity/paternity or a parental leave, a person above the age of 65, the customer can request a full refund and the organizer has an obligation to issue this refund within the following 14 days.</p>\n<p>If the customer attends a compensatory event using his compensation voucher, the organizer's obligation to issue a refund for a purchased ticket is fulfilled.</p>\n<p>The purpose of these <strong>regulations is to prevent the collapse of the cultural sector</strong> by doing both, postponing the organizer's obligation to issue a refund, and by giving the organizer an opportunity to offer a compensatory event.

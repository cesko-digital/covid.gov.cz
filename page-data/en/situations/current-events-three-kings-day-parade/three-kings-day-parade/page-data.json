The most famous custom is the three-king carol<a rel=\"nofollow\">, accompanied by the Three Kings’ Donation. It’s an ancient donation-collecting tradition, while most of the donations collected support the respective local charities and are not distributed countrywide. Unfortunately this year the collectors <strong>won't be able to visit you at your doorstep</strong> - at least until the epidemic situation in the Czech Republic turns better, i.e. until the PES warn level turns to (at least) 4 again.</a></p>\n<p>But no problem - the coordinators are prepared, so you still can enjoy the carol -<a href=\"https://www.trikralovasbirka.cz\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\"> on-line (in Czech only)</a>. While doing so, you may <a href=\"https://www.trikralovasbirka.cz\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">donate </a>as well.

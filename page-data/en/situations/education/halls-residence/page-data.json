This also applies to university students.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions, which apply for example to students who are going through practical education in medical and pedagogical fields or students on work duty.</p>\n<p>I have a residence in a dormitory</p>\n<p>Students without residence in the Czech Republic are allowed to stay in student housing. If a residence is a place where you intend to live or it is a place where you feel at home. In this case hand in a declaration to your university so you can stay living there. </p>\n<p>If you stay in your dormitory, follow hygienic regulations- wear a facemask, disinfect your hands, and practice social distancing.</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Education asks students who have the possibility to return home do so to limit their social contacts.</p>\n<p>Universities regulate the operation of dormitories on their own. If you have any questions, please contact the dormitory operator. If you are at risk of a difficult financial situation in relation to these regulations, reach out to your university, since they can offer you a social scholarship.

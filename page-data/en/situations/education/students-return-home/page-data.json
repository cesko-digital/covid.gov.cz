Please wait for the results of your test in isolation to prevent possible contact of your loved ones with someone Covid-positive.</p>\n<p>If the result of your test is positive, it would be best to wait for your quarantine out in your dormitory room. We recommend the same approach if you are already in quarantine. Finish your quarantine in your dormitory and visit your family afterward.</p>\n<p>If you suffer from any psychological difficulties related to isolation, fear of the illness, or fear for your loved ones, check the section <a href=\"/en/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stress and handling impacts of the pandemic</a>.</p>\n<p>After returning home the student is seen as a member of the household that he has returned to.

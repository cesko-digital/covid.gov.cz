It is also recommended to support workers in taking their vacation time and paid leave, and eventually even other means specified in their respective contracts. The government also calls to limit the activities at work not significant for maintaining the employer’s activities.</p>\n<p>The workplace is one of the most common places where infections occur as there is a large concentration of people from many different areas being together for a long time. Therefore, at a time like this, when there is a high risk of infection, remote working is an effective way to prevent mixing people together. If possible, <strong>stay at home</strong> and <strong>work from there</strong>. The Czech government instructed all employers to discuss with their employees the possibility of remote work if the nature of their working activities allows it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/employment/home-office"},"changed":"2020-11-22T22:30:56+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-06T08:56:08+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/1443715/bozp_prace_z_domova.pdf","title":"Information for employers from the MPSV website"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"work"},"situation_type":{"name":"Employment","path":{"alias":"/situations/employment"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"work"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"The protection of employees","path":{"alias":"/situations/employment/protection-employees","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Employer/Employee relations","path":{"alias":"/situations/tracing-and-testing-faq/employeremployee-relations","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Can an employer order their employees to work from home?","value":"No, the employee must always agree on working from home."},{"question":"Who determines the working hours of the employee when working from home?","value":"The employer.

Specifically, FFP2 (CN 95) and FFP3 (CN 99).</p>\n<p>The abbreviation <strong>FFP</strong> is based on the English term \"filtering facepiece\", the number after this designation indicates the degree of protection, respectively the degree of permeability of respirators according to the European standard:<br />\n <br />\nClass FFP2 (KN95) respirators must capture at least 94% of the airborne particles. For the FFP3 class respirator (KN99) it is 99%.<br />\n </p>\n<h2>Face mask</h2>\n<p>Face masks protect well against the spread of droplets exhaled by the wearer of the mask (it stops the droplets coming from the inside of one's body from getting outside the body) Therefore, the face masks help to protect the others – this is why we use the motto <strong>\"my face mask protects you, your face mask protects me\"</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>When you wear a face mask you also protect yourself.</strong> The protection is not as sufficient as it would be by wearing a respirator, however, the level of protection is definitely higher while using a face mask than with no face covering at all. At least this offers partial protection against droplets exhaled by other people. It also helps you to avoid touching your face directly.</p>\n<p>Masks are either <strong>disposable </strong>(also known as medical or surgical), or <strong>nano masks</strong> that can be used <strong>repeatedly</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong>Respirator with an exhalation valve</strong></h2>\n<p>Respirators with an exhalation valve protect only their wearers from viruses and bacteria from external environments. When the person wearing a respirator with an exhalation valve exhales, it is not filtered in any way. <strong>Therefore, these respirators are not to be worn by people who are infected by COVID-19</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong>Protective face shield</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Please use a face shield only as an extra protection</strong> in combination with a face mask or a respirator. <strong>The face shield itself is not classified as effective protection.</strong> These are used especially in medical facilities or wherever an extra protection is needed. Wearing a face shield helps to cover a larger part of your face.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\n <br />\n </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks-and-respirators/types-protection"},"changed":"2021-03-02T10:34:54+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-03T23:05:32+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.uvex-safety.cz/cs/vedet/normy-asmernice/masky-na-ochranu-dychacich-organu/vyznam-trid-ochrany-ffp","title":"Detailed information about types of FFP respirators (in Czech)"},{"uri":"https://urgmed.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ochrana-dy%CC%81chadel_v6.pdf","title":"Detailed information about respirators with an exhalation valve (in Czech)"},{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/stanovisko-k-noseni-ochranneho-stitu-bez-rousky/","title":"Detailed information about protective face shields (in Czech)"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Face masks and respirators","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks-and-respirators"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"masks"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"How to take care of the face mask","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks-and-respirators/how-take-care-face-mask","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"What is the difference between a respirator and a respirator with an exhalation valve?","value":"Respirators with an exhalation valve provide protection to the wearers only.

Therefore, the face masks help to protect the others – this is why we use this motto <strong>\"my face mask protects you, your face mask protects me\"</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>When you wear your face mask you also protect yourself.</strong> The protection is not as sufficient as it would be by wearing a respirator, however, the level of protection is definitely higher while using a face mask than with no face covering at all. At least this offers partial protection against droplets exhaled by other people. It also helps you to avoid touching your face directly.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>disposable face masks</strong> (also known as medical face masks), or <strong>reusable textile face masks</strong>. Face masks are used to prevent spreading of Covid-19 and are recommended by sufficient professional organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>\n<p><strong>Respirator</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Respirator </strong>(half mask) <strong>provides high protection to the wearer</strong>. It protects the wearer against virus and bacteria coming from outside of the body, and it also stops the virus and bacteria from getting outside the body.</p>\n<p>There are different types of respirators – FFP2, and FFP3. The <strong>FFP </strong>stands for \"Filtering Face Piece\", and the number indicates the level of protection, meaning the level of the filter capacity according to the European Standards:</p>\n<p>The FFP2 type allows a maximum leakage amount of 11%, the FFP3 type allows a maximum leakage amount of 5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Respirator with an exhalation valve</strong></p>\n<p>Respirator with an exhalation valve provides protection to the wearer only. It protects the wearer against virus and bacteria coming from outside of the body. Anything that is exhaled by the wearer is not filtered by the respirator at all. <strong>Therefore, these respirators are not to be worn by people who are infected by COVID-19</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Protective face shield</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please use a face shield only as an extra protection</strong> in combination with a face mask or a respirator. <strong>The face shield itself is not classified as an effective protection.</strong> These are used especially in medical facilities or wherever as an extra protection is needed to be used. Wearing a face shield helps to cover a larger part of your face.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"What is the difference between a respirator and a respirator with an exhalation valve?","value":"Respirators with an exhalation valve provide protection to the wearers only. They protect the wearers against virus and bacteria coming from outside of the body. Anything that is exhaled by the wearer is not filtered by the respirator at all."},{"question":"Is it safe to wear a respirator with an exhalation valve when I've been positively diagnosed with COVID-19?","value":"No. The valve does not filter the air you exhale. Therefore, by wearing this type of respirator, people around you would not be protected."},{"question":"Is it enough to wear a face shield?","value":"No."},{"question":"Does the face mask protect me?","value":"The face mask mainly protects people around you, their face masks protect you.

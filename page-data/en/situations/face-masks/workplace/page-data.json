This includes <strong>nursery teachers</strong>, health workers if it is necessary to perform the first aid (e.g. resuscitation), <strong>public transport drivers</strong>, judges, advocates, prosecutors, experts and interpreters during the trials, performers, hosts, news readers, and persons who work with heat within the 3rd and the 4th burden degree (glassmakers, metallurgist etc.).</p>\n<p>You can also remove your face mask if you work in one place and when there are no colleagues or other people within the safe distance of<strong> at least 2m away from you</strong> (both conditions need to be met at the same time). E.g. while being alone in your office at least 2m away from other people – the face mask can be removed. Please wear your face mask in all other circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>If possible, please work from home.

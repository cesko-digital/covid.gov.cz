As a part of this it was possible to install two applications- eRouška and Mapy.cz. If you agreed the hygienics were able to find people you came into contact with and where you were. This option completely disappeared in the eRouška 2.0 version, which is now completely anonymous.</p>\n<p>Another way to help with tracing is to provide the data from your phone from the last 5 days to create a so called memory map, which will help the infected person better determine their contacts that they met with and remember where they were. This information cannot be accessed without your consent.</p>\n<p>Any monitoring of citizens without them being directly aware of it is impossible. The mobile operator can only share this information with the security forces upon your request.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources (in Czech)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdr.cz/clanek/vlada-spusti-trasovani-mobilnich-telefonu-aby-vedela-s-kym-kdo-byl-v-kontaktu\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Tracing</a> with the help of mobile phones. </p>\n<p>Is there any <a href=\"https://manipulatori.cz/je-duvod-se-obavat-chytre-karanteny/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">reason</a> to be afraid of the “Smart quarantine”? </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://manipulatori.cz/lez-tydne-aplikace-erouska-slouzi-ke-smirovani-obyvatelstva/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Hoax</a>: the eRouška app is used to watch citizens.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/government-watching-your-phones"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T18:26:06+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://cdr.cz/clanek/vlada-spusti-trasovani-mobilnich-telefonu-aby-vedela-s-kym-kdo-byl-v-kontaktu","title":"Tracing using mobile phones"},{"uri":"https://manipulatori.cz/je-duvod-se-obavat-chytre-karanteny/","title":"Is there any reason to worry about smart quarantine?"},{"uri":"https://manipulatori.cz/lez-tydne-aplikace-erouska-slouzi-ke-smirovani-obyvatelstva/","title":"The eRouška application is used to snoop on residents"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"warning"},"situation_type":{"name":"Hoaxes","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"record_voice_over"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":null},"situationArea":{"name":"Hoaxes","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"record_voice_over"},"situation":[{"id":"51b22e8f-607a-582d-a59e-b06e911f5dd1","title":"SMS with a fake positive result","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/sms-fake-positive-result"}},{"id":"fb66b157-7509-506f-875b-474700e8bd54","title":"Non Covid-related deaths blamed on Covid-19","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/non-covid-related-deaths-blamed-covid-19"}},{"id":"a3dae95a-1038-528a-b266-ab987d39206c","title":"Testing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/testing"}},{"id":"f8a909e1-b35b-5527-924f-1059ae573aba","title":"The government is watching your phones","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/government-watching-your-phones"}},{"id":"a41e4eae-7978-5c21-a611-8225bcdfe700","title":"Wearing masks is bad for your health","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/wearing-masks-bad-your-health"}},{"id":"3e84f9bc-de20-5c54-a7e7-1f65c3b706b4","title":"Myths about COVID-19","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-covid-19"}},{"id":"0e5b23c0-4ae3-57a3-9a96-34e016b4596a","title":"Myths about eRouška app","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-erouska-app"}},{"id":"4b63ea05-9605-5bff-9ce1-7afa5df75e87","title":"Dangerous vaccines and foreign soldiers in the Czech Republic","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/dangerous-vaccines-and-foreign-soldiers-czech-republic"}},{"id":"497343c4-f9e6-59e4-bd31-9353f042e307","title":"How can I spot false information?","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/how-can-i-spot-false-information"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/hoaxes/government-watching-your-phones","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/hoaxes","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/hoaxy/sledovani-pohybu-pomoci-mobilu"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4260621986","4279535114"]}

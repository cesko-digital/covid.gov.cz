Its purpose is to convince the reader that there is in fact no pandemic and that everything is just a \"clever\" form of deception to gain control of humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>A pandemic is a mass occurrence of an infectious disease across many different regions. The WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic on 11.3 2020. Up until 3.11. almost 47 million people had been infected worldwide and 1.21 million people had passed away as a result of the infection. All arguments about the inexistence of a pandemic are completely false.</p>\n<p><strong>5G networks spread the coronavirus</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hoax:</strong></p>\n<p>\"The coronavirus and its spread is related to 5G networks.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that is transmitted through respiratory droplets by coughing, sneezing or contact with a contaminated surface. In no case is its spread possible by radio waves. Likewise, there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate any effect of electronic signals on the human immune system or DNA structure.</p>\n<p><strong>The WHO has stated that Covid is not dangerous</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hoax:</strong></p>\n<p>This hoax gained traction after an interview in the discussion program Prima Partie, where Lenka Zlámalová said: “The World Health Organization (WHO) has currently published a completely new study, which we could call a meta-analysis that brings together data from about seventy studies from around the world, which show that the danger of the virus and the mortality of the virus are both many times lower than previously stated. The original figures were 3.4%, while the latest ones mentioned were between 1% and 0.4%. Now the WHO, which still has some authority, says it's 0.23%. To give viewers an idea, this is at the level not of the flu, but common viruses. So I wonder how the government and the new the health minister will react to this. Because if we find that this is the current situation, then the strict measures are completely inadequate. \"</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>This false statement was subsequently spread mainly in disinformation groups on social networks.</p>\n<p>You can find an explanation of this hoax <a href=\"https://manipulatori.cz/hoax-smrtnost-koronaviru-je-podle-studie-who-023/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">here</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-covid-19"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-08T08:19:40+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://hoax.cz/hoax/koronavirus-je-podvod/, https://manipulatori.cz/hoax-koronavirus-je-podvod-ktery-zneuziva-lidske-neznalosti-aneb-kdyby-byla-na-svete-nejaka-pandemie/","title":"Hoax: The coronavirus is a scam"},{"uri":"https://manipulatori.cz/hoax-kdy-konecne-lide-pochopi-ze-zadna-corona-neexistuje/","title":"Hoax: When will people finally understand that the coronavirus is a scam?"},{"uri":"https://manipulatori.cz/hoax-5g-site-snizuji-imunitu-a-napomahaji-tak-sireni-koronaviru/","title":"Hoax: 5G networks reduce immunity"},{"uri":"https://manipulatori.cz/hoaxy-sirici-se-o-5g-sitich/","title":"Another similar hoax"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"icon":{"code":"warning"},"situation_type":{"name":"Hoaxes","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"record_voice_over"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-08T09:23:45+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Hoaxes","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"record_voice_over"},"situation":[{"id":"51b22e8f-607a-582d-a59e-b06e911f5dd1","title":"SMS with a fake positive result","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/sms-fake-positive-result"}},{"id":"fb66b157-7509-506f-875b-474700e8bd54","title":"Non Covid-related deaths blamed on Covid-19","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/non-covid-related-deaths-blamed-covid-19"}},{"id":"a3dae95a-1038-528a-b266-ab987d39206c","title":"Testing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/testing"}},{"id":"f8a909e1-b35b-5527-924f-1059ae573aba","title":"The government is watching your phones","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/government-watching-your-phones"}},{"id":"a41e4eae-7978-5c21-a611-8225bcdfe700","title":"Wearing masks is bad for your health","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/wearing-masks-bad-your-health"}},{"id":"3e84f9bc-de20-5c54-a7e7-1f65c3b706b4","title":"Myths about COVID-19","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-covid-19"}},{"id":"0e5b23c0-4ae3-57a3-9a96-34e016b4596a","title":"Myths about eRouška app","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-erouska-app"}},{"id":"4b63ea05-9605-5bff-9ce1-7afa5df75e87","title":"Dangerous vaccines and foreign soldiers in the Czech Republic","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/dangerous-vaccines-and-foreign-soldiers-czech-republic"}},{"id":"497343c4-f9e6-59e4-bd31-9353f042e307","title":"How can I spot false information?","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/how-can-i-spot-false-information"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-covid-19","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/hoaxes","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/hoaxy/myty-o-nemoci-covid-19"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

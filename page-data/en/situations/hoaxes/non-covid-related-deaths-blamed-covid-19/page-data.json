","content":{"processed":"<h2><strong>Hoax:</strong></h2>\n<p>“Three days ago, my colleagues father-in-law passed away from a heart attack. The autopsy report stated that he died of the coronavirus. When my colleague and his wife wanted an explanation, they got to the director of the hospital who confessed after an argument that they have orders to do so and they get higher rewards for Covid deaths. This is not a lie, it actually happened to my colleague. This happens with most deaths. They lie to us, scare us and manipulate us.”</p>\n<h2>Explanation:</h2>\n<p>This hoax has been appearing in different versions since the so-called “first wave”. Sometimes the hospitals are forced to fake the death reports because of an order from “above” and sometimes they offer a financial reward to the families of the deceased if they agree to state Covid-19 as the cause of death and sometimes it's the funeral services who ask for Covid-19 being stated as the cause of death, as they allegedly get a higher reward.</p>\n<p>There is one thing all of these hoaxes have in common and that's the lack of:  the place where it happened, the name of the hospital or the name of the funeral home. The story always happens to a relative of someone they know. These people never respond to any requests for proof and only refer to their previous statements. The important thing is, there is no such thing as Covid-19 being stated as the cause of death.</p>\n<p>Medical reports only state whether the person was tested for the presence of the SARS-CoV-19 coronavirus, which causes the illness Covid-19. Therefore it doesn't make sense for only Covid-19 being stated as the cause of death.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/non-covid-related-deaths-blamed-covid-19"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T17:44:12+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://hoax.cz/hoax/financni-bonus-pro-pozustale-po-zemrelych-na-covid-19/) Další vysvětlení.

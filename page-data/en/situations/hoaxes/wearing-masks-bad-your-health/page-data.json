Bacteria multiply in face masks. Face masks cause diseases. The WHO did not initially recommend the use of face masks. \"</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>There is currently no evidence that wearing face masks weakens the immune system in any way. It is also nonsense that CO2 would accumulate under the face mask and harm us. The CO2 molecules are so small that it is no problem for them to go through the mask. Only bacteria that you exhale yourself will stay inside the mask. If you use it properly and wash or boil it after each use, there can be no significant multiplication of bacteria.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any evidence that the masks can cause any diseases. The only possible health problem caused by wearing a mask may be an allergic reaction of the skin to the material from which the face mask is made (if you suffer from such an allergy).</p>\n<p>Yes, the WHO did not recommend the use of face masks in the first wave. But it was not because it was ineffective, but for fear of misuse. When used and worn properly, face masks are effective protection against the spread of coronavirus according to the WHO.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://manipulatori.cz/hoax-vysledek-noseni-rousek-vyrazka\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Here</a> is an explanation of the whole hoax (in Czech)</p>\n<p>or <a href=\"https://napravoumiru.afp.com/odbornici-zduraznuji-ze-noseni-rousek-neposkozuje-imunitni-system\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">here</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/wearing-masks-bad-your-health"},"changed":"2021-02-27T19:26:58+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-08T08:04:31+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://manipulatori.cz/hoax-v-zahranici-jiz-umrely-prvni-deti-kvuli-noseni-rousek/","title":"Explanation of hoaxes: The first children have already died because of wearing face masks"},{"uri":"https://manipulatori.cz/fake-news-lide-nosici-casto-nebo-pravidelne-rousky-maji-85-riziko-a-pravdepodobnost-nakazy-nemoci-covid-19/","title":"Explanation of hoaxes: People wearing a face mask have a 85% risk of infection"},{"uri":"https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/who-koronavirus-pandemie_2004032127_sot","title":"More details"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"warning"},"situation_type":{"name":"Hoaxes","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"record_voice_over"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-08T09:07:52+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Hoaxes","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"record_voice_over"},"situation":[{"id":"51b22e8f-607a-582d-a59e-b06e911f5dd1","title":"SMS with a fake positive result","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/sms-fake-positive-result"}},{"id":"fb66b157-7509-506f-875b-474700e8bd54","title":"Non Covid-related deaths blamed on Covid-19","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/non-covid-related-deaths-blamed-covid-19"}},{"id":"a3dae95a-1038-528a-b266-ab987d39206c","title":"Testing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/testing"}},{"id":"f8a909e1-b35b-5527-924f-1059ae573aba","title":"The government is watching your phones","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/government-watching-your-phones"}},{"id":"a41e4eae-7978-5c21-a611-8225bcdfe700","title":"Wearing masks is bad for your health","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/wearing-masks-bad-your-health"}},{"id":"3e84f9bc-de20-5c54-a7e7-1f65c3b706b4","title":"Myths about COVID-19","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-covid-19"}},{"id":"0e5b23c0-4ae3-57a3-9a96-34e016b4596a","title":"Myths about eRouška app","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/myths-about-erouska-app"}},{"id":"4b63ea05-9605-5bff-9ce1-7afa5df75e87","title":"Dangerous vaccines and foreign soldiers in the Czech Republic","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/dangerous-vaccines-and-foreign-soldiers-czech-republic"}},{"id":"497343c4-f9e6-59e4-bd31-9353f042e307","title":"How can I spot false information?","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/how-can-i-spot-false-information"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/hoaxes/wearing-masks-bad-your-health","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/hoaxes","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/hoaxy/rousky"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

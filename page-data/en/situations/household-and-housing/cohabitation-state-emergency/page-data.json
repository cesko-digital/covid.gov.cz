If possible, keep your social contacts through the online platforms during this time. Try to keep your habits and routines as constant as possible. <strong>It is important to eat balanced meals, have enough sleep and rest, and also aim for physical and mental activity.</strong> It is a good idea to keep using stress management methods that have worked for you before and have proven to be effective. There are many ways to reduce stress, such as <strong>relaxation</strong> or <strong>meditation</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can learn about the fundamental recommendations for maintaining mental health in section Stress and handling the impacts of the pandemic &gt; Mental hygiene.</p>\n<p>If you feel that you need to talk to someone, either about a specific problem or just to be in contact with someone, reach to one of the crisis lines.

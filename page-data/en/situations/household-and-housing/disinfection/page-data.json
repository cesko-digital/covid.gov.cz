Slowly mix in 42 ml of hydrogen peroxide and stir it well. Then add 15 ml of glycerol- it is better to use a syringe for this, as it has a very thick consistency, and without the syringe, it is hard to measure the dosage. Then add boiled water so the level reaches 1l, close the container and shake it well. At this point, you can pour it into smaller containers that you can carry it with you. The final product should sit for three days, but if it is necessary, you can use it straight away as it works immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/disinfection"},"changed":"2020-12-17T19:11:51+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T18:12:07+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Household and housing","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"home"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Infected member of the household","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/infected-member-household","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Quarantine","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/quarantine","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Can coronavirus survive on surfaces?

It depends on the material of the object, relative humidity, degree of exposure to sunlight and temperature.

So far, we have limited information about the effects of this disease on animals, so treat your pet like any other member of the household. If there is an infected person in your house, reduce the contact between the infected and the animal to a minimum.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember, that virus can be transmitted on the animal's fur, so wash and disinfect your hands thoroughly before and after contact with the animal.</strong> Do not let strangers stroke your pet.</p>\n<h2><strong>Visits to the vet</strong></h2>\n<p>Before the visit, <strong>always call the veterinarian</strong> and consult with him whether your appointment is necessary. Stay in the waiting room only for the inevitable time and keep a two-meters distance from other people in the room. Wearing a face mask is a must. Try to avoid touching objects that had been touched by people before you, such as handles or railings.</p>\n<p>If you are travelling beyond the border district in order to visit the vet, it is necessary to prove the reason for the travel. To do so, we recommend to fulfil the appropriate <strong>form</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Formular_pro_cesty_mimo_okres_-_vzor.docx\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">word version</a>/<a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Formular_pro_cesty_mimo_okres_-_vzor.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">pdf version</a>) or <strong>affidavit</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Cestne_prohlaseni___vzor.docx\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">word version</a> /<a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Cestne_prohlaseni___vzor.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">pdf version</a>) defining the date, time, and purpose of your travel. You can print out the affidavit template or write it in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Always inform your veterinarian if you think you have met an infected or quarantined person! </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Walking the dog</strong></h2>\n<p>It is allowed to walk the dog (from 5 AM to 9 PM) only within your municipality area.</p>\n<p>During the curfew (from 9 PM to 5 AM) it is allowed to walk the dog only within 500 meters from your residence.</p>\n<p>While walking the dog within your municipality area, you should wear at least a surgical face mask and keep at least 2 meters distancing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Walking the dog in isolation or quarantine</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>If you are in a quarantine of self-isolation, you can ask someone from your relatives/close persons to help you with walking the dog during your quarantine/self-isolation.</strong> Essential animal care is one of several exceptions allowing to leave the district. So if your relatives are from a different district, please advise them to fill in the form of affidavit specified above.</p>\n<p>Animal hand-over should be in compliance with all the hygienic measures – mouth and nose covering (ideally respirator without an exhalation vent), gloves, and hand disinfection.</p>\n<p>Walking the dog during your self-isolation is possible only in case you do have no one to help you with that. In such a situation, please limit the time to spend outdoor to a minimum and avoid places where people usually gather. Wearing a respirator is a must in that case.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/pets"},"changed":"2021-03-03T12:06:38+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T17:29:20+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Household and housing","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"home"}}},"measures":[{"title":"Movement restriction regulations","path":{"alias":"/measures/outdoor-activities/movement-restriction-regulations","langcode":"en"},"valid_from":"2021-03-01T00:00:00+01:00","valid_to":"2021-03-21T23:59:59+01:00","relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}]}}],"related_situations":[{"title":"Quarantine","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/quarantine","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Isolation","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/isolation","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-03-03T12:30:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Household and housing","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"home"},"situation":[{"id":"bddf1658-d854-58c1-b8e4-9a2f725934cb","title":"Domestic violence prevention","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/domestic-violence-prevention"}},{"id":"4398ec5d-5f36-588a-ad42-e9dfaafbe748","title":"Cohabitation in the state of emergency ","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/cohabitation-state-emergency"}},{"id":"2d040c33-9836-5d7c-a0b5-01c6d5f5aa34","title":"Shared household","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/shared-household"}},{"id":"2ba6ad8a-3595-53cc-89d6-437056ba298e","title":"School accommodation facilities","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/school-accommodation-facilities"}},{"id":"66d21277-593e-5d47-9d30-ce9de7e6d777","title":"Infected member of the household","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/infected-member-household"}},{"id":"2165eaf9-ab26-5cd0-b086-d566733e253b","title":"Household (shopping, repairs etc.)","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/household-shopping-repairs-etc"}},{"id":"1dc170e6-e2d8-5d4f-9712-5b17fbbb48de","title":"Pets","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/pets"}},{"id":"161e2c4a-d8b3-5b39-b241-e8c6b361ea75","title":"Constructions and reconstructions","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/constructions-and-reconstructions"}},{"id":"abd78efa-ec6c-5270-a7f2-441dad097817","title":"Recommendations for landlords","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/recommendations-landlords"}},{"id":"ab261859-de7c-5884-9507-8485bed67ea3","title":"Disinfection","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/disinfection"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/household-and-housing/pets","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/household-and-housing","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/domacnost-bydleni/zvirata"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

So far, we have limited information about the effects of this disease on animals, so treat your pet like any other member of the household. If there is an infected person in your house, reduce the contact between the infected and the animal to a minimum.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember, that virus can be transmitted on the animal's fur, so wash and disinfect your hands thoroughly before and after contact with the animal.</strong> Do not let strangers stroke your pet.</p>\n<p><strong>Visits to the vet</strong></p>\n<p>Before the visit, <strong>always call the veterinarian</strong> and consult with him whether your appointment is necessary. Stay in the waiting room only for the inevitable time and keep a two-meters distance from other people in the room. Wearing a face mask is a must. Try to avoid touching objects that had been touched by people before you, such as handles or railings.</p>\n<p><strong>Always inform your veterinarian if you think you have met an infected or quarantined person! </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Walking the dog</strong></p>\n<p>There is an exception to the curfew for dog walking - you can walk your dog even after 9 PM, but only within 500 meters from your house or flat. During the day (5 AM - 8.59 PM), you can walk your dog anytime without restrictions. However, always wear your face mask and keep a two-meters distance from others.</p>\n<p><strong>Walking the dog in isolation or quarantine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you have to quarantine or go to isolation, you should ask someone to walk your dog for you.</strong> During the transmission, please pay extra attention to hygiene measure - wear a face mask or respirator, ideally put on gloves and wash and disinfect your hands thoroughly before and after.</p>\n<p>The quarantined or isolated person can only walk the dog when there is no one else to do it for him/her.

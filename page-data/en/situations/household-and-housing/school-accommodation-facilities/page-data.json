This also applies to the university students.</p>\n<p>There are some <strong>exemptions</strong>. Students of the same class and practical training can stay at the school accommodation facilities. The exemption also applies to all students of medicine and education with <strong>practical training</strong>, and to students with an <strong>obligation to work</strong>.</p>\n<p>Dormitories and halls of residence can be used by PhD students.</p>\n<p><strong>My residential address is at a dormitory/hall</strong></p>\n<p>Students who <strong>do not have another residential address within the grounds of the Czech Republic</strong> may remain in dormitories/halls of residence. The residential address is a place which is considered to be your permanent place to live, <strong>a place where it feels like home to you</strong>. If you provide a consent in which you state the dormitory/hall of residence, not any other place, is a home to you, you may remain living there.</p>\n<p>If you stay in a dormitory/hall of residence, <strong>p</strong><strong>lease </strong><strong>maintain increased hygiene measures</strong> (the rule of 3: face mask – hands – social distancing).</p>\n<p>However, the Ministry of Education is asking, if possible, for <strong>students to return home </strong>and thus reducing their social contacts. <strong>Universities decide on the details of the operation of the dormitories independently</strong>. If you have any questions, <strong>please contact the dormitory operator directly</strong>.</p>\n<p>If this measure may cause you getting into a <strong>difficult social situation</strong>, please contact your school as universities may help their students via social scholarships. <a href=\"https://www.mpsv.cz/mop\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Financial help is also offered by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs</a>.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/school-accommodation-facilities"},"changed":"2020-11-24T22:47:09+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T16:48:52+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Household and housing","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"home"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Universities","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/universities","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Students: the return home","path":{"alias":"/situations/education/students-return-home","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Shared household","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/shared-household","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Cohabitation in the state of emergency ","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/cohabitation-state-emergency","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-06T15:12:53+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Household and housing","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"home"},"situation":[{"id":"bddf1658-d854-58c1-b8e4-9a2f725934cb","title":"Domestic violence prevention","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/domestic-violence-prevention"}},{"id":"4398ec5d-5f36-588a-ad42-e9dfaafbe748","title":"Cohabitation in the state of emergency ","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/cohabitation-state-emergency"}},{"id":"2d040c33-9836-5d7c-a0b5-01c6d5f5aa34","title":"Shared household","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/shared-household"}},{"id":"2ba6ad8a-3595-53cc-89d6-437056ba298e","title":"School accommodation facilities","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/school-accommodation-facilities"}},{"id":"66d21277-593e-5d47-9d30-ce9de7e6d777","title":"Infected member of the household","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/infected-member-household"}},{"id":"2165eaf9-ab26-5cd0-b086-d566733e253b","title":"Household (shopping, repairs etc.)","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/household-shopping-repairs-etc"}},{"id":"1dc170e6-e2d8-5d4f-9712-5b17fbbb48de","title":"Pets","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/pets"}},{"id":"161e2c4a-d8b3-5b39-b241-e8c6b361ea75","title":"Constructions and reconstructions","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/constructions-and-reconstructions"}},{"id":"abd78efa-ec6c-5270-a7f2-441dad097817","title":"Recommendations for landlords","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/recommendations-landlords"}},{"id":"ab261859-de7c-5884-9507-8485bed67ea3","title":"Disinfection","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/disinfection"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/household-and-housing/school-accommodation-facilities","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/household-and-housing","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/domacnost-bydleni/koleje-internaty"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

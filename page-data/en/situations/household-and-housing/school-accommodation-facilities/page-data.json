This also applies to university students.</p>\n<p>There are some <strong>exceptions</strong>. For example, the exception has students participating in practical training as part of their medical and pedagogical courses or students who have been ordered to work duty.</p>\n<p><strong>I live in a hall of residence</strong></p>\n<p>Pupils and students who <strong>do not have other housing</strong> in the Czech Republic can stay in the dormitories. Other housing means a place where you have your permanent address or a place where you <strong>feel at home.</strong> You <strong>can</strong> stay in a residence hall if you can provide a statement that the dormitory is the place where you feel at home the most.</p>\n<p>If you continue to live in your hall of residence, <strong>follow the hygienic measures</strong> (wear a mask - wash your hands regularly - keep a two-meters distance from others).</p>\n<p>However, the Ministry of Education is <strong>urging</strong> pupils and students to, when possible, return home to reduce social contacts between individuals. University halls of residence are deciding on details of their operation independently. If you have any questions, please contact the dormitory operator directly. If you are in danger of a difficult social situation in connection with these measures, contact your school, as universities may award a social scholarship to you.

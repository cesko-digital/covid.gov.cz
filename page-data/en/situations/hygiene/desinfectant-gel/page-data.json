These shops are exempt and remain open during the lockdown.</p>\n<p><strong>You will need: </strong>- alcohol – 96% ethanol or 99,8% isopropylalcohol (in drugstores or paint shops) - 3% hydrogen peroxide (in pharmacies) - 98% glycerol (also known as glycerine; in pharmacies) - sterile or cool boiled water (you can make this at home) - clean, cool and sterilized closable container - measuring cup, syringe (it will make the process easier, however it is possible to proceed withouth it).</p>\n<p><strong>Method: </strong>In a (at least) 1l container add 833ml of alcohol. Slowly mix in 42ml of hydrogen peroxide, mix thoroughly. After this, add 15ml of glycerol – for this step it is better to use a syringe, glycerol is a liquid with a very thick consistency, and it is difficult to measure an accurate amount of it without using the syringe. Add cool boiled water so that the volume adds up to 1l. Close the container and mix thoroughly. After this step, you can move the liquid into smaller travel sized bottles. You should let this solution stand for three days, however it can be used straight away with immediate effect if needed.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"links":[{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/navod-na-vyrobu-domaci-dezinfekce/)","title":"The detailed instruction on how to make a DIY hand sanitizer"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Hygiene","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene"}},"related_situations":[{"title":"What is the purpose of face masks?","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/what-purpose-face-masks","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Room desinfection","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/room-desinfection","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Infected member of the household","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/infected-member-household","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hygiene products at the workplace","path":{"alias":"/situations/business-activities/hygiene-products-workplace","langcode":"en"}}]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/desinfectant-gel"},"changed":"2020-11-06T14:56:19+00:00","valid_from":null,"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/hygiene/desinfectant-gel"}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1446925061","2446164016","3493237958"]}

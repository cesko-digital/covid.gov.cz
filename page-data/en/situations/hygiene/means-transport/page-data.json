Please keep your mouth and nose covered before arriving into these waiting areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Please keep social distancing</strong>. You should social distance before you get on public transport, and also while travelling via public transport if possible. <strong>If not necessary, please do not touch any surfaces </strong>inside public transport (especially handles or rails) as many people will have touched these areas before. For extra protection, you can use gloves – disposable gloves (rubber or plastic gloves), and also textile gloves (we recommend to wash these after arriving home).</p>\n<p>While travelling via public transport, there is a large turnover of people. Therefore please use enhanced hygiene measures. <strong>If possible, avoid travelling via public transport, e.g. walk to your workplace or to the shop</strong>. You will get some fresh air, and you will also reduce the risk of infection.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/means-transport"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":"2020-10-21T00:00:00+02:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T18:57:54+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBAypfiYU_8&feature=youtu.be","title":"Video of how to follow safety measures while travelling via public transport "},{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mimoradne-opatreni-noseni-ochrannych-prostredku-dychacich-cest-s-vyjimkami-s-ucinnosti-od-21-10-2020-do-odvolani.pdf","title":"Emergency Measures of the Ministry of Health"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"directions_bus"},"situation_type":{"name":"Hygiene","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"soap"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How to transport yourself to the testing?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/how-transport-yourself-testing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"What is the purpose of face masks?","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/what-purpose-face-masks","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-06T16:05:12+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Hygiene","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"soap"},"situation":[{"id":"21215034-c680-58d9-9bae-63f638397d27","title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing"}},{"id":"d5a124df-1ae1-59ba-a8eb-9ab3d88866af","title":"Hand sanitizer","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-sanitizer"}},{"id":"e7af96b4-5c03-51e0-b334-c4f651e0ba6a","title":"Means of transport","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/means-transport"}},{"id":"ce0c37ba-7538-5733-817d-92fce3ea1af8","title":"Coughing, runny nose","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/coughing-runny-nose"}},{"id":"2c5a8ed3-397e-531a-a036-7a472a7f1c95","title":"Room desinfection","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/room-desinfection"}},{"id":"68d81de6-9cfb-5f7f-8627-885c3231a998","title":"Desinfection of personal belongings","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/desinfection-personal-belongings"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/hygiene/means-transport","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/hygiene","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/hygiena/dopravni-prostredky"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

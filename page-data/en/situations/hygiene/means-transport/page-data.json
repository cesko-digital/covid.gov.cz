The only adequate protective equipment shall be a respirator of class FFP2 (KN 95) without an exhalation valve or similar device (also without an exhalation valve) which meets a filtration efficiency of at least 94%.</strong></p>\n<p>The following rules are still being applied:</p>\n<p>At stops and in public transport environments, the obligation to <strong>wear a respirator of class FFP2 (CN 95) without an exhalation valve, two medical masks over each other, or another protective means of the nose and mouth with a filtering effect of at least 95%</strong> applies. Cloth drapes, scarves or shawls are no longer sees as sufficient protection. <strong>Children from 3 to 15 years</strong> of age have an exception and <strong>can wear only one medical veil, but we also recommend</strong> the use of two surgical veils or even better a respirator.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to wearing the veil have<strong> children under 2 years of age (including of) and persons with intellectual disabilities and severe mental disorders</strong> if they cannot wear the veil due to this condition. You do not need a veil or respirator for the time necessary to <strong>consume food and drink.</strong> However, if possible, consume food and drink only after getting out of the vehicle. <strong>This will protect yourself and others.</strong></p>\n<p>At stops and in public transport, the <strong>obligation to have a veil applies.</strong> Therefore, keep your mouth and nose covered when you arrive at the stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Please keep social distancing</strong>. You should social distance before you get on public transport, and also while traveling via public transport if possible. <strong>If not necessary, please do not touch any surfaces </strong>inside public transport (especially handles or rails) as many people will have touched these areas before. For extra protection, you can use gloves – disposable gloves (rubber or plastic gloves), and also textile gloves (we recommend washing these after arriving home).</p>\n<p>While traveling via public transport, there is a large turnover of people. Therefore please use enhanced hygiene measures. <strong>If possible, avoid traveling via public transport, e.g. walk to your workplace or to the shop</strong>. You will get some fresh air, and you will also reduce the risk of infection.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/means-transport"},"changed":"2021-02-28T10:14:25+00:00","valid_from":"2020-10-21T00:00:00+02:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T18:57:54+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBAypfiYU_8&feature=youtu.be","title":"Video of how to follow safety measures while travelling via public transport "},{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mimoradne-opatreni-noseni-ochrannych-prostredku-dychacich-cest-s-ucinnosti-od-3-12-2020-do-odvolani.pdf","title":"Emergency Measures of the Ministry of Health"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"directions_bus"},"situation_type":{"name":"Hygiene","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"soap"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How to transport yourself to the testing?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/how-transport-yourself-testing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"What is the purpose of face masks and respirators?","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks-and-respirators/what-purpose-face-masks-and-respirators","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-02-27T20:05:12+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Hygiene","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"soap"},"situation":[{"id":"21215034-c680-58d9-9bae-63f638397d27","title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing"}},{"id":"d5a124df-1ae1-59ba-a8eb-9ab3d88866af","title":"Hand sanitizer","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-sanitizer"}},{"id":"e7af96b4-5c03-51e0-b334-c4f651e0ba6a","title":"Means of transport","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/means-transport"}},{"id":"ce0c37ba-7538-5733-817d-92fce3ea1af8","title":"Coughing, runny nose","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/coughing-runny-nose"}},{"id":"2c5a8ed3-397e-531a-a036-7a472a7f1c95","title":"Room desinfection","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/room-desinfection"}},{"id":"68d81de6-9cfb-5f7f-8627-885c3231a998","title":"Desinfection of personal belongings","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/desinfection-personal-belongings"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/hygiene/means-transport","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/hygiene","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/hygiena/dopravni-prostredky"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

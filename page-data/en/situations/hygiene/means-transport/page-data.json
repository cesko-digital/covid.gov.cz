Please keep your mouth and nose covered before arriving into these waiting areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Please keep social distancing</strong>. You should social distance before you get on public transport, and also while travelling via public transport if possible. <strong>If not necessary, please do not touch any surfaces </strong>inside public transport (especially handles or rails) as many people will have touched these areas before. For extra protection, you can use gloves – disposable gloves (rubber or plastic gloves), and also textile gloves (we recommend to wash these after arriving home).</p>\n<p>While travelling via public transport, there is a large turnover of people.

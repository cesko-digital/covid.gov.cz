It is very <strong>accurate </strong>and <strong>efficient</strong>. This test is able to detect a COVID-19 infection even <strong>before </strong>the person becomes <strong>infectious </strong>and will allow <strong>early isolation</strong>. Thus, this method is able to <strong>prevent </strong>the transmission of the virus to other hosts.</p>\n<p>The disadvantages are the financial cost compared to the antigen tests, the longer evaluation time, and the need for highly professional staff for sample handling.</p>\n<h2>Rapid Antigen test</h2>\n<p>Detects <strong>viral proteins.</strong> The rapid antigen test reveals patients at the <strong>peak of the infection</strong> when the body has the highest concentration of these proteins.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage is that they are not as sensitive (accurate) as the standard RT-PCR tests used to accurately identify those infected. When using them, a significant percentage of those infected pass the test as a false negative. In a few days, these people will spread the virus among others, thinking they are healthy.</p>\n<p>Their advantage is the <strong>price</strong>, the <strong>result within 30 minutes</strong> and lower demands on the expertise of the staff.</p>\n<p>If you are being tested with the Rapid Antigen test, you are NOT guaranteed to be uninfected at the time of taking the test.</p>\n<h2>Antibody test</h2>\n<p>This test measures antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the bodies of people who have already had COVID-19 or are successfully recovering from the disease. Antibodies are not present at the onset of the disease.<br />\n </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/difference-between-rt-pcr-test-rapid-antigen-test-and"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T20:56:37+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02661-2","title":"Further information"},{"uri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThG_02miq-4","title":"How does RT-PCR work?"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":{"code":"science"},"situation_type":{"name":"Infection and general measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"coronavirus"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Quarantine","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/quarantine","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Isolation","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/isolation","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How to get tested?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/how-get-tested","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How to transport yourself to the testing?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/how-transport-yourself-testing","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-10T14:48:34+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Infection and general measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"coronavirus"},"situation":[{"id":"21ec9da1-e526-5707-83a1-82c4bfdb4afc","title":"Can coronavirus survive on surfaces?

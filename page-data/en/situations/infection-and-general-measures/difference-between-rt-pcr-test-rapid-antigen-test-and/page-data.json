It is very <strong>accurate </strong>and <strong>efficient</strong>. This test is able to detect a COVID-19 infection even <strong>before </strong>the person becomes <strong>infectious </strong>and will allow <strong>early isolation</strong>. Thus, this method is able to <strong>prevent </strong>the transmission of the virus to other hosts.</p>\n<p>The disadvantages are the financial cost compared to the antigen tests, the longer evaluation time, and the need for highly professional staff for sample handling.</p>\n<h2>Rapid Antigen test</h2>\n<p>Detects <strong>viral proteins.</strong> The rapid antigen test reveals patients at the <strong>peak of the infection</strong> when the body has the highest concentration of these proteins.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage is that they are not as sensitive (accurate) as the standard RT-PCR tests used to accurately identify those infected. When using them, a significant percentage of those infected pass the test as a false negative. In a few days, these people will spread the virus among others, thinking they are healthy.</p>\n<p>Their advantage is the <strong>price</strong>, the <strong>result within 30 minutes</strong> and lower demands on the expertise of the staff.</p>\n<p>If you are being tested with the Rapid Antigen test, you are NOT guaranteed to be uninfected at the time of taking the test.</p>\n<h2>Antibody test</h2>\n<p>This test measures antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the bodies of people who have already had COVID-19 or are successfully recovering from the disease. Antibodies are not present at the onset of the disease.<br />\n </p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"relationships":{"related_situations":[{"title":"Quarantine","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/quarantine","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Isolation","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/isolation","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How to get tested?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/how-get-tested","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How to transport yourself to the testing?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/how-transport-yourself-testing","langcode":"en"}}],"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Infection and general measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures"}},"measures":[]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/difference-between-rt-pcr-test-rapid-antigen-test-and"},"changed":"2020-11-08T19:15:25+00:00","valid_from":null,"links":[{"uri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02661-2","title":"Further information"}],"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/difference-between-rt-pcr-test-rapid-antigen-test-and","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/onemocneni-obecne-o-opatrenich/rozdil-mezi-rt-pcr-testem-rapid-antigen-testem-protilatkovym"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1446925061","2446164016","3292154253","3751664530"]}

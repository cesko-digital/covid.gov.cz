If you are <strong>tested positive</strong>, you are given a <strong>unique code</strong> together with the results of your test.</p>\n<p>If you <strong>enter this code</strong> into <strong>eRouška</strong>, the app can alert those <strong>potentially infected</strong> about <strong>their risky encounter</strong>. Having the <strong>knowledge </strong>that they <strong>met </strong>someone who is <strong>infected</strong>, they can be more <strong>cautious </strong>and <strong>protect </strong>those in high-risk groups.</p>\n<h2>I got an SMS, telling me I'm positive</h2>\n<p>If you received a positive PCR test result, read the <a href=\"https://erouska.cz/en/sms\" rel=\"nofollow\">detailed instructions</a>.

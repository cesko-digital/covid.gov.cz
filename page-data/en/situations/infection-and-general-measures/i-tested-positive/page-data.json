If the antigen test is positive, it depends on whether or not you have symptoms of the disease. If you have symptoms, you are considered positive and the same applies to you as if you tested positive for a PCR test (see text below). If you do not have symptoms, you are sent for a control PCR test (on the spot) and it depends on the results. You can read more details in <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/antigenni-testovani/interpretace-vysledku-antigenniho-testu-jak-se-zachovat-po-obdrzeni\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Interpreting the antigen test result.</a></p>\n<p>However, if you have been sent for the test by the hygiene or a general practitioner, you will be tested with the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/onemocneni-obecne-o-opatrenich/rozdil-mezi-rt-pcr-testem-rapid-antigen-testem-protilatkovym\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">PCR test </a>straight away. You will usually receive the PCR test results in 24-48 hours.</p>\n<p>In the case of a <a href=\"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/letak-Vysledek-testu-POZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">positive PCR test result</a>, you will receive three test messages. The laboratory informs you about the test result via a text message, then you will receive information for <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/onemocneni-obecne-o-opatrenich/samoreportovani\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">self-report</a> and the verification code of the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/onemocneni-obecne-o-opatrenich/erouska\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">eRouška</a> application. The tracing center will also contact you by phone.</p>\n<p>Prepare a list of your “risky contacts”. These are people you have met at a distance of less than 2 meters and one or both sides were without adequate respiratory protection (only a disposable mask or respirator are considered adequate protection, not a cloth mask, scarf or shawl). If both parties have adequate respiratory protection, contact at a distance of less than 2 meters is not considered hazardous. If you are suspected of being infected with a new variant of the SARS-Cov-2 virus (British, South African, Brazilian, etc.), your situation will be assessed individually by the epidemiologist, regardless of the protective equipment used. Contact tracking window depends on whether you have COVID-19 symptoms or not. If you have symptoms, then monitor contacts from the last 2 days before the symptoms. If you do not have symptoms, monitor contacts from the last 5 days before the test.</p>\n<p>From the moment you receive a positive test result, stay in <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/onemocneni-obecne-o-opatrenich/izolace\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">home isolation.</a></p>\n<p>Inform your GP about the test result.

Also, inform your employer by phone about your situation and inform all your risky contacts.</p>\n<p>If you use the eRouška application, anonymously notify other users who have been in contact with you of the positive test result.</p>\n<p>Treatment of a mild course corresponds to the treatment of influenza. If your health gets worse, contact your GP immediately. In case of serious health complications, call 155 or 112.</p>\n<p>Stay in isolation for at least 14 days. Isolation is ended by a general practitioner based on your medical condition.</p>\n<p>If the tracing system is overloaded, the tracing center may not be able to contact you by phone. In this case, you will receive a text message with the following wording (or similar):</p>\n<p><em>For X.Y. (r.n. XXXX): you have been reported by KHS as positive for COVID-19. Inform your GP as soon as possible and the person you have been in close contact with in the last 5 days before the test up to today. These persons must go into quarantine and inform their general practitioner. Follow the rules of ISOLATION for at least 14 days from the positive test result.

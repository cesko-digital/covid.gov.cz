This index is calculated both for the whole Czech Republic and for individual regions. The index is developed in broad cooperation with experts from universities, the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic and the UZIS CZ. It will be calculated by the UZIS CZ.</p>\n<p>The evaluation takes place on a scale of 0 - 100%, where 0% does not represent any risk, 100% the highest risk.</p>\n<p>The degree of risk can easily be derived from the calculated risk index.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the risk index calculated?</strong></p>\n<p>The risk index adds up points for the evaluation of four risk indicators related to the status and course of the covid-19 epidemic.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>How many people have been infected recently?</strong> Rating: 0-20 points</li>\n</ul><p>14-day numbers positive for covid-19 (per 100,000 inhabitants).</p>\n<ul><li><strong>How many seniors have been infected recently?</strong> Rating: 0-20 points</li>\n</ul><p>14-day numbers of seniors positive for covid-19 (per 100,000 population aged 65+).</p>\n<ul><li><strong>The number of infected people is growing - is the virus spreading in the population?</strong> Rating: 0-30 points.

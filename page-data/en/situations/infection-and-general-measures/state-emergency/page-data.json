The Government or the Chamber of Deputies can cancel the state of emergency.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crisis measures </strong></h2>\n<p>These are measures <strong>intended to eliminate or ease the consequences of these difficult times.</strong></p>\n<p>The implementation of a crisis measure <strong>can restrict certain rights and freedoms and impose specific obligations.</strong> Crisis measures may be i<strong>ssued by the government in the event of a declared state of emergency</strong> based on the law on Crisis Management and on the Amendment of Certain laws (Crisis Act).<br />\n </p>\n<p>The state of emergency has been extended until 28th February 2021.

Covid-19 can cause serious illness with possible unknown long-term consequences or even death of people of any age, including otherwise healthy people.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca's covid-19 vaccines are ordered for 3 million doses, BioNTech and Pfizer 4 million doses, Johnson &amp; Johnson 2 million doses. The Czech Republic is also interested in 1 million doses from CureVac and 1.9 million from Moderna. We are still negotiating with Sanofi. The number of doses may not match the number of people that can be vaccinated. Some vaccines require 2 doses, others need one. <strong>A total of 10 million doses for approximately 6.9 million people are currently pre-ordered through the EU mechanism</strong>.</p>\n<p>The first registered vaccines are from Pfizer and BioNTech, which arrived in the Czech Republic on 26 December with a total of 9,750 doses. Healthcare professionals and seniors will be preferentially vaccinated.</p>\n<p>The vaccines were distributed to the Central Military Hospital, the General University Hospital and the Bulovka Hospital. The second half of the delivery goes to the University Hospital Brno and the University Hospital at St. Anne's in Brno.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is known about vaccination so far</strong></h2>\n<p>Vaccinations in the Czech Republic should be covered by public health insurance, voluntarily and preferential for risk groups and health professionals, social workers and other important occupations for the state.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaccination will be provided at</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>hospitals,</li>\n<li>vaccination centers of health institutes and the State Health Institute,</li>\n<li>the offices of general practitioners, doctors providing occupational health services,</li>\n<li>the other providers of health services, contractual facilities of health insurance companies,</li>\n<li>via mobile vaccination teams.</li>\n</ul><p>Vaccination will be completely voluntary, but remember that <strong>vaccination is the most effective way to stop the spread of the epidemic</strong> in our country and in the world in the long run. History has taught us that the spread of infectious diseases other than vaccination cannot be stopped. It can only be slowed down and reduced, using other measures (face masks, safe distancing, collective restrictions, etc.). The chance to vaccinate the population offers us a chance to defeat the covid-19 pandemic permanently after almost a year of living with restrictions and limited free movement.</p>\n<p>The vaccine will be given in a two-dose schedule with an interval of 21 days. The vaccination procedure lasts about 15 minutes, each vaccinated person is observed for additional 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>If you have been tested positive the vaccination is recommended no earlier than 90 days after the first positive test result.</p>\n<p><strong>The exact date of the start of vaccination is not yet known, it is expected during February 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you did not find the information you are looking for in this text, see the links and FAQ below, where you will find further details on the current situation regarding coronavirus vaccination in the Czech Republic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Regulations for health care providers</strong></h2>\n<p>From 27 December 2020, all health care providers performing vaccination against COVID-19 are ordered to immediately record the data on the performed vaccination in the ISIN Infectious Diseases Information System, the COVID-19 Patients module. The record will be made after logging in on the page of the departmental medical registers EREG, https://ereq.ksrzis.cz/.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/when-we-will-have-vaccine"},"changed":"2021-02-01T20:36:15+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T22:40:19+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"security"},"situation_type":{"name":"Infection and general measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"coronavirus"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Central reservation system","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/central-reservation-system","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Who will be vaccinated first?","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/who-will-be-vaccinated-first","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Who should not get vaccinated?","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/who-should-not-get-vaccinated","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"General vaccination of citizens","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/general-vaccination-citizens","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Why should I get vaccinated?","value":"Anyone who is vaccinated helps to protect those who cannot do so due to their health. Also, the impacts of covid-19 means financial burden for the average households. In case of complications of this disease, of course, hospitalisation is necessary, which is usually followed by convalescence. The vaccine will prevent all this."},{"question":"When will the COVID-19 vaccine be available?","value":"None of the COVID-19 vaccines are currently approved in the EU. According to the legislation, vaccines of this type must be registered centrally, i.e. such registration is granted by the European Commission on the basis of an expert evaluation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA has already received marketing authorization applications for two vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. An opinion on Pfizer could be issued by the end of the year."},{"question":"How long must it take between the 1st and 2nd dose of the vaccine for two-dose vaccines?","value":"The administration of two doses with an interval of 28-30 days is expected. It depends on the final evaluation by the EU system in the framework of vaccine approval."},{"question":"When does vaccination start and who gets the vaccine first?","value":"Once the vaccines is registered, distribution can begin. This will take place gradually, according to production capacities, and that is why the vaccination strategy determines the groups of the population that will be vaccinated preferentially. The first wave is mainly seniors, risk groups and health professionals."},{"question":"Will everyone get vaccinated?","value":"Yes. The Czech Republic has ordered a sufficient number of vaccines for all its inhabitants. At the moment, vaccines for approximately 5.5 million inhabitants of the Czech Republic are obligatorily ordered, and it is possible to order vaccines for up to another 10.6 million people in advance. The Czech Republic therefore has sufficient vaccines for all persons."},{"question":"For whom will the vaccination be suitable?","value":"Vaccines are being developed for adults. At least initially, they will not be suitable for children or pregnant women. In order to gain collective immunity, 65-70% of the population must be vaccinated."},{"question":"What is the price of the vaccine?","value":"Vaccination against COVID-19 is OPTIONAL and FREE."},{"question":"For how long will the vaccine protect me?","value":"This information is currently unknown, nor is the need for revaccination."},{"question":"Which of the vaccines will be available first in the Czech Republic and how does it work?","value":"The first vaccine available is the Pfizer, probably on December 26. This vaccine uses so-called mRNA technology. It is also used in a number of other vaccines, such as against the flu, Zika virus, rabies and cytomegalovirus, and against some types of tumors.

Also, the impacts of covid-19 means financial burden for the average households. In case of complications of this disease, of course, hospitalisation is necessary, which is usually followed by convalescence. The vaccine will prevent all this."},{"question":"When will the COVID-19 vaccine be available?","value":"None of the COVID-19 vaccines are currently approved in the EU. According to the legislation, vaccines of this type must be registered centrally, i.e. such registration is granted by the European Commission on the basis of an expert evaluation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA has already received marketing authorization applications for two vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. An opinion on Pfizer could be issued by the end of the year."},{"question":"How long must it take between the 1st and 2nd dose of the vaccine for two-dose vaccines?","value":"The administration of two doses with an interval of 28-30 days is expected. It depends on the final evaluation by the EU system in the framework of vaccine approval."},{"question":"When does vaccination start and who gets the vaccine first?","value":"Once the vaccines is registered, distribution can begin. This will take place gradually, according to production capacities, and that is why the vaccination strategy determines the groups of the population that will be vaccinated preferentially. The first wave is mainly seniors, risk groups and health professionals."},{"question":"Will everyone get vaccinated?","value":"Yes. The Czech Republic has ordered a sufficient number of vaccines for all its inhabitants. At the moment, vaccines for approximately 5.5 million inhabitants of the Czech Republic are obligatorily ordered, and it is possible to order vaccines for up to another 10.6 million people in advance. The Czech Republic therefore has sufficient vaccines for all persons."},{"question":"For whom will the vaccination be suitable?","value":"Vaccines are being developed for adults. At least initially, they will not be suitable for children or pregnant women. In order to gain collective immunity, 65-70% of the population must be vaccinated."},{"question":"What is the price of the vaccine?","value":"Vaccination against COVID-19 is OPTIONAL and FREE."},{"question":"For how long will the vaccine protect me?","value":"This information is currently unknown, nor is the need for revaccination."},{"question":"Which of the vaccines will be available first in the Czech Republic and how does it work?","value":"The first vaccine available is the Pfizer, probably on December 26. This vaccine uses so-called mRNA technology. It is also used in a number of other vaccines, such as against the flu, Zika virus, rabies and cytomegalovirus, and against some types of tumors.

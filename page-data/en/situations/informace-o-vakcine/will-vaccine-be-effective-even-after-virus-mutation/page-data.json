The aim will be to try to eliminate them as much as possible from the population.</p>\n<p>Similarly as in case of flu, the vaccines would have to need to adapt to circulating strains of the virus. New kinds of vaccines (vectors and mRNA), however allow quick reaction on changing circumstances.  </p>\n<p>At the same time there will be necessary to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and antivirals effective against them, but also new effective vaccines. With a bit of luck, even these serious complications could be managed quickly. </p>\n<p>Original author of the text: prof.

Every vaccination centre must ensure immediate availability of the first aid in the case of life-threatening complications associated with the vaccination.</p>\n<h2>1. Vasovagal syncope</h2>\n<p>Vasovagal syncope is sudden, short-term loss of consciousness which may result in a fall. In case of fall, it is necessary to keep that individual in a horizontal position and do not try to lift him/her up. Please let them in that position couple of minutes, you can also lift the patient’s lower limbs. Firstly, a cardiac arrest should be ruled out according to baseline resuscitation algorithms (<a href=\"https://www.resuscitace.cz/doporucene-postupy\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">https://www.resuscitace.cz/doporucene-postupy</a>) – available only in Czech.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. </strong>Anaphylactic reaction</h2>\n<p>Possible manifestations of anaphylaxis:</p>\n<ul><li>Skin – pruritus, erythema, exanthema, urticaria, edema</li>\n<li>Respiratory tract – runny nose, cough, heaves, asthma attack</li>\n<li>Digestive tract – nausea, stomachache, vomiting, diarrhea</li>\n<li>Circulatory system – pallor, cold sweat, thready pulse, tachycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia</li>\n<li>Nervous system – nervousness, fear, anxiety, headache, a disorder of consciousness</li>\n</ul><p>Mild forms of anaphylaxis can be demonstrated with only a few symptoms from the list.</p>\n<p>General manifestations of anaphylaxis:</p>\n<ul><li>Graduation and a combination of local symptoms.</li>\n<li>A shocking state develops (loss of consciousness, spasm) and can lead to respiratory or cardiovascular failure.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>First Pre-Medical Aid</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of first pre-medical aid is to maintain vital functions. The patient should be positioned into Trendelenburg position – head declined below the feet, make sure the airway is clear and start the cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>\n<p><strong>First Aid (medical)</strong></p>\n<p>It is recommended to follow the anaphylaxis handling algorithm by Czech Resuscitation Council.

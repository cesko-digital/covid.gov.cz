","content":{"processed":"<p>One of the rumours that have emerged is that vaccination against Covid-19 can cause infertility. The reason should be that the RNA structure of coronavirus, resp. its protein is similar to the structure of the uterine lining which can be affected by vaccination. Each cell of a living organism is equipped with a certain protein composition. However, the protein in a virus differs from the protein structure of human body and thus of the uterine lining. The vaccine cannot change the uterine lining and therefore interfere with the fertility of the human body.</p>\n<p><em>Původní autorka textu: MUDr. Hana Roháčová, Ph.D.</em></p>\n<p>You can see the summary in 15 seconds on <em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Uw2YddJ_u5I\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Youtube</a>.

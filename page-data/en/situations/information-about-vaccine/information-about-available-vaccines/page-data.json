As we know many coronaviruses and occurrence many of them are not uncommon even in the Czech Republic, the scientists were able to profit from the knowledge of both previous vaccines and known coronavirus strains. When the new coronavirus revealed its pandemic potential, the scientists could benefit from long years ongoing research. Thanks to prior research findings they knew on what virus parts focus the attention and what is the genetic information of the new variant. Although the process of vaccine development usually takes a very long time, much of this time is due to various delays caused predominantly by the administrative parts of that process. In the case of covid-19 vaccine, bureaucratic parts were minimized to speed up the whole development of the vaccine. All the necessary tests (safety, effectiveness, side effects) were carried out in a standard way."}],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-02-03T15:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Information about vaccine","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"},"situation":[{"id":"39a1d220-470b-5187-bdf2-8e45bd7daba5","title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines"}},{"id":"7eacc921-ffe2-5f31-91aa-e210f846cc69","title":"How vaccination works?

This recommendation also applies to the postponement of the administration of the second dose in case of illness after the first dose. Reinfection within 3 months after being ill with Covid-19 is unlikely according to available data. Therefore, if vaccine availability is limited, we recommend postponing vaccination of the first or second dose for 3 months after having Covid-19 or asymptomatic infection (after a positive test) after isolation. However, in the case of a high risk of infection, it is possible to vaccinate no earlier than 3 months after covid-19 disease. It is always necessary to assess the severity of the Covid-19 disease, adjustment of health and clinical condition at the time of vaccination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Progression of Covid-19 before the second dose</strong></p>\n<p>If a positive test for Covid-19 is detected between the first and second dose of vaccination, the second dose is postponed for at least 7 days after the detection of a positive test for Covid-19 in the asymptomatic course and at least for 14 days after the disease, respectively, in both cases after the end of isolation (according to the recommendations of the Czech Vaccination Society). The intervals between individual doses must be maintained.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Contact with a Covid-positive person</strong></p>\n<p>In persons quarantined due to contact with a Covid-19 positive person, vaccination can be started immediately after quarantine has ended (according to the recommendations of the Czech Vaccination Society). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Treatment with Covid-19 monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma</strong></p>\n<p>There are currently no data on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in subjects who have received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma for treatment. Based on the estimated half-life of these products and evidence that suggests that reinfection is unusual within 3 months of the previous infection, vaccination should be delayed for 3 months after receiving monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. The reason for postponing vaccination is to prevent possible interference of antibody treatment with the immune response elicited by the vaccine (according to the recommendations of the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Missing the interval between doses</strong></p>\n<p>The maximum interval between the first and second dose of the vaccine has not been established. If the second dose of vaccine is not given at the recommended interval according to the SPC of the vaccine, the first dose is counted and the second dose is given as soon as possible (as recommended by the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Shortened interval between doses</strong></p>\n<p>If given incorrectly 17 or 18 days after the first dose, it is not necessary to repeat the second dose. In case of incorrect administration earlier than 17 days after the first dose, the second dose is considered invalid and must be repeated 21 days after the incorrectly administered dose (according to the recommendation of the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Simultaneous application of other vaccines</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination when co-administering another vaccine, it is not recommended to co-administer with any other vaccines. The administration of another vaccine (live attenuated and non-live) is recommended at least 14 days after the application of the Covid-19 vaccine. If another vaccine is inadvertently administered within these 14 days, it is not necessary to repeat the dose of any of the vaccines (as recommended by the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/specific-situations-during-vaccination"},"changed":"2021-02-08T21:55:05+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-08T21:55:05+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-1-Dodatek-4-Organizace-o%C4%8Dkovac%C3%AD-m%C3%ADsto.pdf","title":"Organizace očkování na očkovacím místě"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Information about vaccine","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"From registration to vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/registration-vaccination","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Frequently asked questions to the Ministry of Health","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/frequently-asked-questions-ministry-health","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"I registered for vaccination, but I have nowhere to enter my PIN2, or I did not receive it","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/i-registered-vaccination-i-have-nowhere-enter-my-pin2-or-i-did-not","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Adverse reactions guidelines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/adverse-reactions-guidelines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"What we know about the side effects of the vaccine","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/what-we-know-about-side-effects-vaccine","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Do we know what will occur with our body 10 years after the vaccination?","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/do-we-know-what-will-occur-our-body-10-years-after-vaccination","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Will vaccine alter my DNA?","path":{"alias":"/situations/informace-o-vakcine/will-vaccine-alter-my-dna","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Can I be infertile after I receive the vaccination?","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/can-i-be-infertile-after-i-receive-vaccination","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-01-15T03:08:47+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Information about vaccine","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"},"situation":[{"id":"39a1d220-470b-5187-bdf2-8e45bd7daba5","title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines"}},{"id":"7eacc921-ffe2-5f31-91aa-e210f846cc69","title":"How vaccination works?

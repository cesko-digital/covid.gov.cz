And for some of them vaccination will not be permitted.</p>\n<p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>\n<p>Covid-19 vaccination is not granted for small children as there have been no clinical studies examining the impact of vaccination on children. Thus, the impact on children has not yet been documented properly. It is therefore possible that children may be vaccinated in the future, but this is conditioned by prior approval of the vaccine also for children by relevant EU authorities.</p>\n<p>Vaccine by Pfizer/Biontech is not granted for children under 16 years. Vaccine by Moderna is not granted for children under 18.</p>\n<p><strong>INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE ALLERGY</strong></p>\n<p>Please consult vaccination with your allergist or GP if you suffer from severe allergic reactions. It is possible that vaccination will not be recommended to you.</p>\n<p>In general, no one with an allergy to any of the vaccine components should be vaccinated. On the contrary, any common allergy (pollen, cats, etc.) is not considered to be risky. However, you should consult your allergies with GP before registering for a vaccination.</p>\n<p><strong>INDIVIDUALS WITH IMMUNITY DISORDERS</strong></p>\n<p>It is up to your GP if vaccination is meaningful for you. If your immune disorder is not considered to be serious, the vaccine may be extremely helpful in that case. Serious immunity disorders can be found as a reason for not recommending the vaccine for that individual.</p>\n<p>This does not apply for individuals with weakened immune system for a reason other than a disorder of the immune system (oncological diseases, transplantation, etc.). in that cases you are recommended to check whether your diagnosis allow you <a href=\"/situace/ockovani/jak-funguje-prioritizacni-system\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Jak funguje prioritizační systém?\">priority vaccination</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING WOMEN</strong></p>\n<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding your baby, always consult vaccination with your GP or gynecologist. Due to lack of research evidence in this field, vaccination for pregnant women can be discussed as an option only in case of benefits for mother and fetus are higher than possible negative effects. It is not known whether are excreted in human breast milk. Studies with animals indicate neither direct nor indirect harmful effect on reproductive toxicity.</p>\n<p>If you reasonably think you may be pregnant, please contact your gynecologist to confirm or disprove your pregnancy. We strongly recommend following an advice given by the specialist while considering the possibility to vaccinate yourself.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/who-should-not-get-vaccinated"},"changed":"2021-02-02T16:22:58+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-02T13:44:34+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Information about vaccine","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Central reservation system","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/central-reservation-system","langcode":"en"}},{"title":" Is it possible that people die as a result of vaccination?","path":{"alias":"/situations/informace-o-vakcine/it-possible-people-die-result-vaccination","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"General vaccination of citizens","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/general-vaccination-citizens","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Will the vaccine be effective even after the virus mutation?","path":{"alias":"/situations/informace-o-vakcine/will-vaccine-be-effective-even-after-virus-mutation","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-02-02T12:02:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Information about vaccine","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"},"situation":[{"id":"0b0315a7-53e6-5838-90fd-640eca273a11","title":"Who should not get vaccinated?","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/who-should-not-get-vaccinated"}},{"id":"ca8fcde9-5cf6-539c-8293-f7fca82e98bc","title":"Will vaccine alter my DNA?","path":{"alias":"/situations/informace-o-vakcine/will-vaccine-alter-my-dna"}},{"id":"205a762b-3838-5b1e-943d-b82a96bcaa09","title":" Is it possible that people die as a result of vaccination?","path":{"alias":"/situations/informace-o-vakcine/it-possible-people-die-result-vaccination"}},{"id":"f97ac3a9-390f-58e5-82e5-3e7963199a15","title":"Will the vaccine be effective even after the virus mutation?","path":{"alias":"/situations/informace-o-vakcine/will-vaccine-be-effective-even-after-virus-mutation"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/who-should-not-get-vaccinated","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/information-about-vaccine","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/informace-o-vakcine/kdo-se-nemel-nechat-ockovat"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

You can ride your bike in the<strong> allowed time (5 AM - 8.59 PM)</strong>. Cycling out of the given time is permitted only <strong>in these cases</strong>: transport to and from work, the exercise of the profession and urgent travel to protect life, health and property.</p>\n<p>There is no duty to wear a face mask or face covering during sport. Nevertheless, you should consider wearing it on the bike as well. During the ride, it is necessary to keep a two-meters distance from others, and you should avoid mass cycling. If you are bypassing someone, try to maintain as much spacing as possible. But most of all, be careful not to harm yourself while riding - now is not the best time to be hospitalized.</p>\n<p><strong>It will be possible to ride a bike from 5 AM until 22:59 PM from November 23.</strong></p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/cycling"},"changed":"2020-11-20T22:29:20+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T12:32:11+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Leisure time","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"deck"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Do I need to have a face mask while cycling?","value":" No, wearing face mask is not mandatory, but you should consider wearing one.

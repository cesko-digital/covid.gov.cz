The current situation is not really made for dating, but if you are careful enough, you can go on a date with someone, despite the global pandemic.</p>\n<h2>Who to go out with?</h2>\n<p><strong>If one of you - or both - has already been through COVID-19 infection,</strong> you can rejoice - <strong>the risk of infection is small.</strong> However, if you have not yet had COVID-19, <strong>strongly consider whether there is a risk of infection.</strong> If the other half is someone who you already know, you can get a good picture of how big the risk of infection is. A student living alone will surely be a less risky person than someone who shares an apartment with other people and does not work from home. If someone you <strong>do not know asks you for a date</strong> (for example via Tinder), <strong>we recommend postponing the in-person date to a better epidemiological situation.</strong></p>\n<h2>Where to go?</h2>\n<p>You do not have many options at the moment. Due to the ban on the free movement of people, <strong>we recommend staying in the park or nature</strong> - along the way you can visit the window of the local cafe, which you can support in these difficult times. <strong>Dating in a face mask</strong> is understandably annoying, but if you take it off, it is at your own risk. Only members of the household have an exception to the general obligation of wearing a face mask. Do not forget that nowadays <strong>you can also date over the internet</strong> - instead of a personal meeting, schedule a video call (Zoom, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.)</p>\n<h2>More advice</h2>\n<p>If you experience any of the <strong>symptoms of COVID-19 in the days after the date, notify your partner immediately.</strong> And do not forget - <strong>you have to be home by 9 PM,</strong> otherwise you risk breaking the curfew.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Can I go out for a date?

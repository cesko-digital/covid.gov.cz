Considering the ban on free movement, however, any amateur sport activity group is allowed to consist of <strong>6 persons maximum only.</strong>  Outdoor gyms stay accessible and you are exempted from the obligation to wear a mask when carrying out your sports activity. However, you are urged to obey the strengthened hygienic rules, especially to keep a distance and to sanitize your hands regularly.</p>\n<h2><strong>Running, jogging &amp; other individual sport arts</strong></h2>\n<p>Running/jogging is allowed in the open as well as on the way there. When carrying out a sports activity the obligation to wear a mask does not apply, although it is recommended to do so.</p>\n<p>These regulations apply accordingly for other individual sport arts as well, meaning that it is still possible, for instance, to carry out an open air golf session. </p>\n<h2><strong>Professional sport </strong></h2>\n<p>Professional sportsmen are exempted from the group size restriction as well as from the ban on access and using indoor sport facilities. The term \"professional sportsman\" regards a person whose sport activities constitute his/her employment, business or similar. Professional sportsmen are <strong>allowed to carry out sport activities in order to prepare themselves to upcoming events outdoor as well as indoor, regardless of the number of persons present.</strong></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, they must obey all valid hygienic regulations - especially regarding keeping a distance and sanitizing hands. When carrying out the sport activity itself, they are exempted from the obligation to wear a mask, but upon the end of a training unit, they have - according to valid regulations - to put their masks on again.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/other-sports"},"changed":"2020-11-23T14:41:48+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T11:25:24+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"sports_handball"},"situation_type":{"name":"Leisure time","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"deck"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Sporting events","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/sporting-events","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Gyms, outdoor gyms, sports centers, outdoor sports grounds","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/gyms-outdoor-gyms-sports-centers-outdoor-sports-grounds","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":"2020-11-20T23:59:59+01:00","last_updated":"2020-11-06T18:36:20+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Leisure time","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"deck"},"situation":[{"id":"479a9310-19d8-559e-b065-32a22f5db09c","title":"Sporting events","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/sporting-events"}},{"id":"101291e5-7cd9-5c73-b78a-53b8ee646993","title":"Castles and palaces","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/castles-and-palaces"}},{"id":"b2970e60-b59d-51ad-9ee6-d6cafab498fb","title":"Zoos and botanical gardens","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/zoos-and-botanical-gardens"}},{"id":"7c9e145b-a07e-5402-a701-69c7c2826981","title":"Other sports","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/other-sports"}},{"id":"86b25c85-8d1c-52cb-a092-f5994eed9f2c","title":"Football","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/football"}},{"id":"f53efa42-c901-5aaf-98f4-02f9f09ae990","title":"Spiritual activities","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/spiritual-activities"}},{"id":"12ca154a-40d0-56ed-830e-dc0888db388b","title":"CURRENT: Slavic carnival, slaughter feast","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/current-slavic-carnival-slaughter-feast"}},{"id":"a389fae5-b51f-537a-b779-57f7d4bf0bac","title":"Gyms, outdoor gyms, sports centers, outdoor sports grounds","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/gyms-outdoor-gyms-sports-centers-outdoor-sports-grounds"}},{"id":"f301b2a7-1ba1-534c-896a-196b14ad1261","title":"Pools, saunas","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/pools-saunas"}},{"id":"5395a089-3506-5729-a989-11969d078924","title":"Dancing classes","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/dancing-classes"}},{"id":"cf72a412-8618-53b8-b05d-84c7ab6da834","title":"Trips, camping","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/trips-camping"}},{"id":"18a19904-9b0d-5c3c-b624-b8903a9e60e9","title":"Children's hobby groups","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/childrens-hobby-groups"}},{"id":"711c5d3a-ef2a-5634-a4f1-28311bca34b9","title":"Cycling","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/cycling"}},{"id":"f3e710dd-b95e-5326-9653-d9ae9e88924d","title":"Cottages and cabins","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/cottages-and-cabins"}},{"id":"9e7ab98e-dd4c-5159-b278-e6674d9af233","title":"Musical instruments and singing","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/musical-instruments-and-singing"}},{"id":"0752520d-58c3-5943-bf96-48bc90818805","title":"Meetings, parties, family celebrations","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/meetings-parties-family-celebrations"}},{"id":"84e73bdf-8b41-5f35-bd44-30a7216220eb","title":"Gardening","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/gardening"}},{"id":"86c3cfc7-cf9d-5946-bf2d-45462df8f228","title":"Staying in the park","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/staying-park"}},{"id":"96fc2f55-64d3-5e90-a0d4-e6a7856ba9d3","title":"Dating","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/dating"}},{"id":"756a8f69-8b9d-5e7b-8e7e-494480f7de3b","title":"Family","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/family"}},{"id":"401fffa2-4026-56f3-9f6e-8e33ef2c9312","title":"Maternity centres and school clubs","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/maternity-centres-and-school-clubs"}},{"id":"1cf0a708-fab8-512e-8412-6954342194a8","title":"Winter sports","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/winter-sports"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/leisure-time/other-sports","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/leisure-time","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/volny-cas/dalsi-sporty"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

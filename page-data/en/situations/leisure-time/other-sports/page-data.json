But you can do sport outside with one more person maximum (according to the ban on the free movement of people). In that manner, team sports, such as basketball, football, volleyball, tennis (doubles), hockey, floorball, badminton, squash and others<strong> cannot currently be played neither on indoor or outdoor sports grounds.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Running and other individual sports</strong></h2>\n<p>Jogging is allowed in the park or in nature (and on the way there). The obligation to wear a face mask does not apply to sports, but we recommend that you still wear it. Similar rules apply to other individual sports.</p>\n<h2><strong>Professional sports</strong></h2>\n<p>Professional athletes are exempted from the ban. A professional athlete is a person who performs sport as his or her primary job or as a business or other similar activity. Professional athletes are allowed to play sports in order to prepare for future events. <strong>They can use both indoor and outdoor sports grounds in unlimited numbers of people.</strong> However, they are still required to <strong>observe all hygienic measures</strong> - keep the distance and disinfect hands. Athletes do not have to wear a face mask during the sport itself, but after training, it is necessary to put on the face mask again in accordance with the regulations.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Can I go out to play football with my friends?","value":"No."},{"question":"Can I go for a jog to the park?","value":"Yes."},{"question":"Can I play football in our garden with my dad and brothers?","value":"Yes."},{"question":"Can I go for a jog to the park with my girlfriend?","value":"Yes, but keep the distance from others (or wear a face mask if necessary)."}],"relationships":{"related_situations":[{"title":"Sporting events","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/sporting-events","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Gyms, outdoor gyms, sports centers, outdoor sports grounds","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/gyms-outdoor-gyms-sports-centers-outdoor-sports-grounds","langcode":"en"}}],"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Leisure time","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time"}},"measures":[]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/other-sports"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","links":[],"valid_to":"2020-11-20T23:59:59+01:00"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/leisure-time/other-sports","langCode":"en","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/volny-cas/dalsi-sporty"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1446925061","209121880","2446164016","3292154253"]}

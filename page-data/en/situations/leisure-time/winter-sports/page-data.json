Using an outdoor icy area (e.g. a frozen pond) is allowed, considering the group size restriction (6 persons maximum). Professional sportsmen are exempted from this restriction - in case they are preparing themselves for an upcoming event, they are allowed to use indoor as well as outdoor sport facilities. Skating on natural ice rinks (i.e. not frozen ponds) will be allowed for the public as well. When carrying out this activity, it's obligatory to obey all hygienic regulations, especially the \"Wear Z\" rule.</p>\n<h2>Cross-country skiing</h2>\n<p><strong>Cross-country skiing stays allowed. </strong>It's obligatory, however, to obey all hygienic regulations. During a sport activity, you are exempted from the obligation to wear a mask - nevertheless, it's very important to maintain a 2-meter distance to other skiers.</p>\n<h2>Aprés ski</h2>\n<p>Details regarding operation of restaurants can be found under <a href=\"/situace/restaurace-bary-kavarny/rezim-provozu\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Režim provozu\">Restaurants &gt; mode of operation.</a></p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/winter-sports"},"changed":"2020-12-26T20:35:46+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T13:06:13+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"sports_hockey"},"situation_type":{"name":"Leisure time","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"deck"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Wearing masks is bad for your health","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/wearing-masks-bad-your-health","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":{"processed":"<ul><li>Vnitřní a venkovní kluziště budou zavřená.</li>\n<li><strong>Od 27. 12. bude zakázán provoz lyžařských vleků a lanovek. </strong></li>\n</ul>","valid_from":"2020-12-27T00:00:00+01:00","pes":"5"},"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-12-26T15:45:59+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Leisure time","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"deck"},"situation":[{"id":"479a9310-19d8-559e-b065-32a22f5db09c","title":"Sporting events","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/sporting-events"}},{"id":"101291e5-7cd9-5c73-b78a-53b8ee646993","title":"Castles and palaces","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/castles-and-palaces"}},{"id":"b2970e60-b59d-51ad-9ee6-d6cafab498fb","title":"Zoos and botanical gardens","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/zoos-and-botanical-gardens"}},{"id":"7c9e145b-a07e-5402-a701-69c7c2826981","title":"Other sports","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/other-sports"}},{"id":"86b25c85-8d1c-52cb-a092-f5994eed9f2c","title":"Football","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/football"}},{"id":"f53efa42-c901-5aaf-98f4-02f9f09ae990","title":"Spiritual activities","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/spiritual-activities"}},{"id":"12ca154a-40d0-56ed-830e-dc0888db388b","title":"CURRENT: Slavic carnival, slaughter feast","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/current-slavic-carnival-slaughter-feast"}},{"id":"a389fae5-b51f-537a-b779-57f7d4bf0bac","title":"Gyms, outdoor gyms, sports centers, outdoor sports grounds","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/gyms-outdoor-gyms-sports-centers-outdoor-sports-grounds"}},{"id":"f301b2a7-1ba1-534c-896a-196b14ad1261","title":"Pools, saunas","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/pools-saunas"}},{"id":"5395a089-3506-5729-a989-11969d078924","title":"Dance classes","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/dance-classes"}},{"id":"cf72a412-8618-53b8-b05d-84c7ab6da834","title":"Trips, camping","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/trips-camping"}},{"id":"18a19904-9b0d-5c3c-b624-b8903a9e60e9","title":"Children's hobby groups","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/childrens-hobby-groups"}},{"id":"711c5d3a-ef2a-5634-a4f1-28311bca34b9","title":"Cycling","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/cycling"}},{"id":"f3e710dd-b95e-5326-9653-d9ae9e88924d","title":"Cottages and cabins","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/cottages-and-cabins"}},{"id":"9e7ab98e-dd4c-5159-b278-e6674d9af233","title":"Musical instruments and singing","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/musical-instruments-and-singing"}},{"id":"0752520d-58c3-5943-bf96-48bc90818805","title":"Meetings, parties, family celebrations","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/meetings-parties-family-celebrations"}},{"id":"84e73bdf-8b41-5f35-bd44-30a7216220eb","title":"Gardening","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/gardening"}},{"id":"86c3cfc7-cf9d-5946-bf2d-45462df8f228","title":"Staying in the park","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/staying-park"}},{"id":"96fc2f55-64d3-5e90-a0d4-e6a7856ba9d3","title":"Dating","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/dating"}},{"id":"756a8f69-8b9d-5e7b-8e7e-494480f7de3b","title":"Family","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/family"}},{"id":"401fffa2-4026-56f3-9f6e-8e33ef2c9312","title":"Maternity centres and school clubs","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/maternity-centres-and-school-clubs"}},{"id":"1cf0a708-fab8-512e-8412-6954342194a8","title":"Winter sports","path":{"alias":"/situations/leisure-time/winter-sports"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/leisure-time/winter-sports","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/leisure-time","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/volny-cas/zimni-sporty"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

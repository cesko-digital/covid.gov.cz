Follow all hygienic regulations e.g. <strong>regular ventilation of the room to ensure enough fresh air, don't shout or sing because both of these activities lead to higher transmission of respiratory droplets</strong>. If you want to take preventative measures you can wear a mask, disinfect your hands before congratulating someone and sit further apart. Wash your hands before you eat as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Bars, clubs, restaurants, cafés and other similar facilities are open. </strong>However, specific hygiene rules apply - a maximum of 4 people can sit at a table, while the total capacity of the restaurant may be filled to a maximum of 50%.

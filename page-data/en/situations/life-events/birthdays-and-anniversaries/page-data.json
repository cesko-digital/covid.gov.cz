Follow all hygienic regulations e.g. <strong>regular ventilation of the room to ensure enough fresh air, don't shout or sing because both of these activities lead to a higher transmission of respiratory droplets</strong>. If you want to take preventative measures you can wear a mask, disinfect your hands before congratulating someone and sit further apart.

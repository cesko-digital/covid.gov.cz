There can be a maximum of 10 people present, including the couple, the officiator and the registrar.</p>\n<p>The wedding reception cannot be held in a restaurant or other catering facilities. The general ban on presence of the public in restaurants applies. You can meet with your loved ones after the wedding ceremony for example at home. Follow the general rules related to free movement and hygienic regulations, even during the consuming of food and the toast.</p>\n<p>During the ceremony there is an exception from the obligation to wear a face mask. You have to put your mask back on once the ceremony is over. You can only take it off for the necessary amount of time when taking a photo.</p>\n<p>Weddings are allowed to happen but there is a limited amount of guests and it is necessary to follow all hygienic regulations. It is up to you whether you want to get married now or wait until a better epidemiological situation. Once the risk of infection is lower, these rules will be less strict and you will be able to get married with more guests, a bigger celebration and live music.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/life-events/weddings"},"changed":"2020-11-17T09:07:11+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T21:00:24+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"account_circle"},"situation_type":{"name":"Life events","path":{"alias":"/situations/life-events"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"supervisor_account"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Indoor","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/indoor","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Registered partnership","path":{"alias":"/situations/life-events/registered-partnership","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Accommodations","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/accommodations","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Mode of operation","path":{"alias":"/situations/restaurants/mode-operation","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Operation of Offices","path":{"alias":"/situations/offices-and-institutions/operation-offices","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Is the couple part of the 15 person limit?","value":"Yes."},{"question":"Is the officiator part of the 15 person limit?","value":"Yes."},{"question":"Can I have a wedding if I'm in isolation or quarantine?","value":"No. When in quarantine or isolation, you have to be at home.

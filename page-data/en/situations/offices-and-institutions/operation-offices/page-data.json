This will help reduce the risk of infection to you and those around you.</p>\n<p>You can also set up a <strong>data-box free of charge</strong> for online communication with the authorities. The data-box can be set up at any CzechPoint branch.

If you go to the office in person, it is necessary to have a facemask at all times, disinfect your hands and keep your distance. Keep a distance not only when in the queue but also<strong> when communicating with the officials</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is good to first call the office before the visit to find out <strong>if it is necessary for you to go to the office physically</strong>, and possibly arrange a specific date of the visit. This will avoid risky waiting in a queue.</p>\n<p>Send all documents by mail beforehand.</p>\n<p>Increased hygienic measures must be observed by the employees of the office among themselves.

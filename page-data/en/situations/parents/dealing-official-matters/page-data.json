You can find the opening hours for each Office on the official board of the given office, which is placed by the office building entrance.</p>\n<p>Written and/or telephone contact is preferable over a personal visit to the office. This will help reduce the risk of infection to you and those around you.</p>\n<p>You can also set up a data-box free of charge for online communication with the authorities. The data-box can be set up at any CzechPoint branch. If you have an e-ID (eObčanka), you can set up a data box <a href=\"https://www.datoveschranky.info/-/zrizeni-datove-schranky-online-eidentita-bez-navstevy-czechpoint\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">online</a>.</p>\n<p>Only necessary matters should be handled in person. If you go to the office in person, it is necessary to have a facemask at all times, disinfect your hands and keep your distance. Keep a distance not only when in the queue but also when communicating with the officials.</p>\n<p>If you need to stay at home with your child, fill out the application <a href=\"https://eportal.cssz.cz/web/portal/tiskopisy-zoppd-m\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">form</a> for nursing. If you need more information about compensation within the nursing home, you can find it in <a href=\"/en/situations/compensation/caregivers-allowance-self-employed-ii\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caregiver's allowance for self-employed II</a> or <a href=\"/en/situations/compensation/caregivers-allowance-full-time-employeespeople-work-agreements\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caregiver's allowance for full-time employees</a> section.</p>\n<p>If you are the recipient of housing allowance, child allowance or you have an increased care allowance of CZK 2,000, an extraordinary measure applies to you. Therefore, you do not have to document anything and submit to the Labor Office of the Czech Republic income or paid costs for housing for the months of July, August, September. You will receive the same amount automatically for the months of October, November, and December.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/dealing-official-matters"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-08T20:08:50+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"family_restroom"},"situation_type":{"name":"Parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"family_restroom"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Legal help - social situation","path":{"alias":"/situations/social-situations/legal-help-social-situation","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Job loss - social situation","path":{"alias":"/situations/social-situations/job-loss-social-situation","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Caregiver’s allowance for full-time employees/people with work agreements","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/caregivers-allowance-full-time-employeespeople-work-agreements","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Caregiver’s allowance for self-employed II","path":{"alias":"/situations/compensation/caregivers-allowance-self-employed-ii","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":"2020-11-20T23:59:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"family_restroom"},"situation":[{"id":"17f8c447-913e-5385-b9f2-cd1fd06d8763","title":"Psychological help for parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/psychological-help-parents"}},{"id":"78de9182-760a-5882-819d-5291b37fe248","title":"Playgrounds","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/playgrounds"}},{"id":"58b3d2f7-3fc7-564c-839b-79498a7b2db2","title":"Children's contact with their friends","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/childrens-contact-their-friends"}},{"id":"b12fde2b-2123-5268-8e94-8a7dfa0b6357","title":"Divorced families","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/divorced-families"}},{"id":"3ecdd960-2111-52ae-9aff-18d1cb1d19cf","title":"Dealing with official matters","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/dealing-official-matters"}},{"id":"8a1b2c38-8cdf-57d4-8302-be08259b52fb","title":"Child's illness","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/childs-illness"}},{"id":"c42a63a7-3a8e-51b2-80a8-1c61b170852e","title":"Child birth","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/child-birth"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/parents/dealing-official-matters","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/parents","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/rodice/vyrizovani-urednich-zalezitosti"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4260621986","4279535114"]}

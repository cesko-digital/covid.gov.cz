This will help reduce the risk of infection to you and those around you.</p>\n<p>You can also set up a data-box free of charge for online communication with the authorities. The data-box can be set up at any CzechPoint branch. If you have an e-ID (eObčanka), you can set up a data box <a href=\"https://www.datoveschranky.info/-/zrizeni-datove-schranky-online-eidentita-bez-navstevy-czechpoint\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">online</a>.</p>\n<p>Only necessary matters should be handled in person. If you go to the office in person, it is necessary to have a facemask at all times, disinfect your hands and keep your distance. Keep a distance not only when in the queue but also when communicating with the officials.</p>\n<p>If you need to stay at home with your child, fill out the application <a href=\"https://eportal.cssz.cz/web/portal/tiskopisy-zoppd-m\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">form</a> for nursing.

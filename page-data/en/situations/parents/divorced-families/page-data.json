Travel for the purpose of transferring or taking over children is one of the exceptions to restrictions on the free movement of people. An exception is also granted for the purpose of necessary travel to family or close ones.</p>\n<p>From a legal point of view, therefore, there is no reason not to comply with the court's decision concerning children.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is necessary to consider all the risks and try to create rules that reduce the possibility of disease transmission. Especially if the risk of infection is higher for one of the parents (such as health professionals or other people who are in contact with sick or generally more people). However, such adjustments to the regime should be based on the agreement of both parents.</p>\n<p>A change in alternating care is also strongly recommended in the event that one of the parents finds himself in isolation or quarantine. In this case, the transfer of the child should not take place. If the child is in the care of a parent who has to start quarantine for some reason, the child should remain in quarantine with that parent. If, on the other hand, the child is currently in the care of one parent and should transfer to a parent who has to start or is in quarantine as part of alternating care, we recommend that this transfer not take place.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"relationships":{"related_situations":[{"title":"Psychological help for children and students","path":{"alias":"/situations/children-and-students/psychological-help-children-and-students","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Psychological help for parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/psychological-help-parents","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Keeping in touch with family","path":{"alias":"/situations/seniors/keeping-touch-family","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Christmas family gathering","path":{"alias":"/situations/aktualni-vanoce/christmas-family-gathering","langcode":"en"}}],"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents"}},"measures":[]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/divorced-families"},"changed":"2020-11-08T20:01:13+00:00","valid_from":null,"links":[],"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/parents/divorced-families","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/rodice/rozvedene-rodiny"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1446925061","2446164016","3292154253","3751664530"]}

This also applies to playgrounds.</p>\n<p>Also, keep a distance of 2 meters from other people and do not associate. Try to make sure that children behave within the framework of these recommendations.</p>\n<p>Do not enter the field of play if it is already so busy that it would not be possible to keep distances from other people. In this case, consider the security of the area and the risk of infection.</p>\n<p>Try to limit the length of your stay on the field so that people do not accumulate in the place, but rather take turns.</p>\n<p>We recommend that both child and you thoroughly disinfect their hands after visiting the playground.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/playgrounds"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-08T19:40:06+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":{"code":"family_restroom"},"situation_type":{"name":"Parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"family_restroom"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Measures on free movement","path":{"alias":"/situations/free-movement-people/measures-free-movement","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Wearing masks is bad for your health","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/wearing-masks-bad-your-health","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Disinfection","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/disinfection","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-08T20:40:06+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"family_restroom"},"situation":[{"id":"17f8c447-913e-5385-b9f2-cd1fd06d8763","title":"Psychological help for parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/psychological-help-parents"}},{"id":"78de9182-760a-5882-819d-5291b37fe248","title":"Playgrounds","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/playgrounds"}},{"id":"58b3d2f7-3fc7-564c-839b-79498a7b2db2","title":"Children's contact with their friends","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/childrens-contact-their-friends"}},{"id":"b12fde2b-2123-5268-8e94-8a7dfa0b6357","title":"Divorced families","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/divorced-families"}},{"id":"3ecdd960-2111-52ae-9aff-18d1cb1d19cf","title":"Dealing with official matters","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/dealing-official-matters"}},{"id":"8a1b2c38-8cdf-57d4-8302-be08259b52fb","title":"Child's illness","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/childs-illness"}},{"id":"c42a63a7-3a8e-51b2-80a8-1c61b170852e","title":"Child birth","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/child-birth"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/parents/playgrounds","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/parents","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/rodice/detska-hriste-detske-koutky"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

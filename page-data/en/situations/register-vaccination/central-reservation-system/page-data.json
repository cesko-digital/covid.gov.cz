You register through the website and you will receive a vaccination date. The system works similarly to the antigen testing system. The Central Reservation System (CRS) works as a registration and reservation for vaccination and fully provides you through the vaccination process. The system is designed to support prioritisation. It is designed so that the registration can be done on behalf of the elderly (by family members, social workers, general practitioners, or it is possible to use the help line 1221). The system is linked to the Infectious Diseases Information System (ISIN).</p>\n<p><strong>How to register and secure a vaccination date?</strong></p>\n<p>The central registration system was launched on 15 January 2021 for all 80+ people.</p>\n<p>1. You must register on the website <a href=\"https://crs.uzis.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">crs.uzis.cz</a>, or <a href=\"https://registrace.mzcr.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">registrace.mzcr.cz</a> - both links are functional and available only in the Czech language. Both links will direct you to the online registration form for citizens, indicating your interest and consent to vaccination. Fill in the attributes for prioritisation (including a group type), i.e. information about yourself.</p>\n<p>2. Prioritisation will take place - a point score is calculated together with the vaccine delivery plan that determines when you will be asked to book a specific date. If capacity allows, you will receive an appointment immediately. However, it may happen that due to the capacity reasons you do not immediately receive the exact date. Instead, you receive an SMS and an email confirming your registration, and as soon as the capacity allows, you will be assigned a date. You can find more info about the prioritisation system in a <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/ockovani/jak-funguje-prioritizacni-system\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">life situation on the web</a>. Get acquainted with the procedure and note that there will be no prioritisation within the first few days.</p>\n<p>3. Reservation of dates (for both doses) - based on the PIN2 code sent in the SMS, you are allowed to book both vaccination dates in the central reservation system.</p>\n<p>You may not receive your PIN2 immediately as it depends on the vaccines availability. Find out more in Life Situations <a href=\"https://covid.pristup.net/situace/registrace-na-ockovani/postup-registrace-rezervace\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Registration and Booking Procedure</a> and <a href=\"https://covid.pristup.net/situace/registrace-na-ockovani/zaregistrovala-jsem-se-na-ockovani-ale-nemam-kam-zadat-pin2-nebo-mi\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">I have registered for vaccination, but I have nowhere to enter my PIN2 or I did not receive it.</a></p>\n<p>4. Vaccination itself - the vaccination and the documentation, i.e. registration of the operation in the ISIN register using an eRequest (it does not have to be prescribed by a general practitioner or hygiene, the registration itself is enough) and confirmation of vaccination for citizens.</p>\n<p>The reservation can be conducted by family members, social workers and staff of the information line 1221 on behalf of the elderly (who do not have experience with the internet or simply do not know how to register). It will be necessary to create an effective communication campaign in order for the vaccination to be effective. The principle of the registration presumes the gradual release of reservations in the CRS for priority groups according to the vaccine supply plan. In exceptional circumstances it is possible to supplement the registration, for example, from the non-priority group according to the registrations that will be available. The free spaces will be filled from other registrations (usually people with a lower score/age). The algorithm is created based on the capacity and supply.</p>\n<p><strong>How the Central Reservation System (CRS) works?</strong></p>\n<p>The CRS is not just a standard reservation system for vaccinations. It also provides non-standard booking processes (two dates at different intervals depending on the type of vaccine) and also ensures a second “available” date for vaccination. In addition, it includes a prioritised parameters calculator. It adjusts the prioritisation of parameters based on the state of vaccine supply; citizens' interest in vaccination and occupancy of vaccination sites. The CRS is identical for the whole Czech Republic. The connection to the ISIN is important for example for issuing and verifying certificates of vaccination; including support for mobile devices and compatibility with the EU and WHO standards, or for keeping an electronic vaccination card.</p>\n<p>All types of vaccination sites must use the CRS (except for the GPs once they are involved in vaccination). The CRS processes personal data based on Article 6 (1) (e) and Article 9 (2) (i) of the GDPR as necessary for the fulfilment of the task performed in the public interest entrusted as administrator by the Ministry of Health in the field of public health and the protection against serious health threats. The persons interested in vaccination will be informed about the processing of their data filled in the form. The processing of personal data is carried out by the GDPR Regulation.</p>\n<p>The system must be designed on the principles of central registration and prioritisation, as well as central reservation management due to the nature of the process and the need for capacity management concerning vaccine supplies. Therefore, it is not possible to use the existing reservation systems by the health care providers, because there is no mechanism for passing detailed information about the current priority groups. The form is the starting point for entering the vaccination process. Provides access to vaccination registration from one place (form/web MH). It is required to fill in the form. The person who expresses his / her interest in carrying out the vaccination will be provided with the information necessary to carry out the vaccination.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/central-reservation-system"},"changed":"2021-02-25T10:45:03+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-01T19:48:05+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-4-IT-podpora.pdf","title":"IT podpora očkování"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How vaccination works?

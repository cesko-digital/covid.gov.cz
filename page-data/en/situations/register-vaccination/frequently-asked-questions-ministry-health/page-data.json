Many people from the 80+ group have only 3 digits after the slash. </p>\n<p><strong>Is it possible to register more people on one telephone number? </strong></p>\n<p>Yes, a unique identifier is a health insurance number/birth number.  </p>\n<p><strong>I accidentally deleted PIN2. What should I do? </strong></p>\n<p>From next week (3rd week of the year) it will be possible to call Line 1221, wherewith your assistance, the operator will be able to view your PIN2. This is provided in case when you have booked yourself or that someone close to you has helped you with the reservation.

","meta_description":"Informations about the vaccination order of each risk groups. ","content":{"processed":"<p> The world pandemic is an unprecedented situation in contemporary history. The virus is an enemy that can not be prepared for in advance. The vaccine can be developed only after the particular virus can be analyzed. For those reasons, it is unbelievable that several safe and effective vaccines have been developed in a single year. Unfortunately, it is not possible neither in production nor logistically to make vaccines available for everyone. Production capacities are limited. This situation will improve and vaccines will be more accessible.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that it does not reach everyone, it is necessary to first vaccinate those on whom the virus has the greatest impact in order to return to normal, pre-pandemic life as quickly and smoothly as possible. With regard to the specificity of resources (availability of the vaccine over time, staff capacity, etc.), the prioritization of individual groups of persons to be vaccinated first is determined in order to immunize as soon as possible the part of the population whose worsening health conditions may overload the health system, or these are the people who die of coronavirus most often.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>System prioritization takes into account 3 parameters:</strong></p>\n<p>- age </p>\n<p>- medical anamnesis,</p>\n<p>- occupation.</p>\n<p>Based on these parameters a number is assigned to the most threatened groups. This number assigns them the order in which they will be vaccinated. The higher number, the sooner vaccination will be applied.</p>\n<p>In phase 1A it is a point scale of 11-14, no group has a value of 12.</p>\n<p><strong>The specific groups are: </strong></p>\n<p>14 - health status (no other parameter has this point evaluation):</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>clients of retirement homes, homes with a special regime, homes for people with disabilities, and relief services in the residential form (vaccinations will be provided by the vaccination provider and KKOČ - regional vaccination coordinator)</p>\n</li>\n<li>clients hospitalized in follow-up and long-term inpatient care facilities (vaccinations will be provided by the vaccination provider and KKOČ)</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n<p>13 - <em>age of the person</em> (no other parameter has this point evaluation):</p>\n<ul><li>people over the age of 80 and those who will be 80 the next day can also register (as in the case of election)</li>\n</ul><p>During the vaccination, these persons will prove themselves with an ID card and health insurance card.</p>\n<p>11 - <em>occupation</em>:</p>\n<ul><li>healthcare professionals and persons involved in the care of COVID-19 positive persons and persons working at sampling points or with potentially infectious material (employer confirmation will be required),</li>\n<li>healthcare professionals (employer confirmation will be required),</li>\n<li>medical students, volunteers, agency workers and others involved in the provision of health care, the care of COVID-19 positive patients and the collection or processing of potentially infectious material (employer confirmation will be required),</li>\n<li>employees of public health authorities conducting epidemiological investigations in the disease outbreak (employer confirmation will be required),</li>\n<li>MVČR employees working in closed MVČR buildings with established COVID-19 quarantine (detention facility) (service card),</li>\n<li>employees and members of the VSČR working in prisons with COVID-19 positive prisoners (service card),</li>\n<li>employees of retirement homes, homes with special regimes, homes for the disabled and respite services who come into direct contact with users of social services, members of the Czech Armed Forces assisting in facilities providing residential social services (vaccinations are provided by the vaccination provider and KKOČ).</li>\n</ul><p>The above groups were chosen with regard to the high degree of threat to their health, ensuring the functionality of the health system in the Czech Republic in terms of the threat of lack of medical staff. The aim is then to vaccinate 70% of this group (1A) and if the goal is not achieved, it can only be due to insufficient interest (vaccination is voluntary).</p>\n<p><strong>In phase 1B, groups with points numbers 1 - 5 will be vaccinated:</strong></p>\n<p>This phase also includes hospitalized persons over 65 years of age and hospitalized persons who are chronic patients with clinically risk factors. These two groups do not have an assigned number as they do not register via CRS (Central Registration System). Registration and their verification will be provided by the vaccination provider or more precisely the vaccination site.</p>\n<p>5 - occupation<em>:</em></p>\n<ul><li>indispensable technical and economic staff for the operation of hospitals,</li>\n<li>critical employees of critical infrastructure - members of the Czech Armed Forces/Ministry of Defense. </li>\n<li>other social care employees in direct contact with clients, thus employees of all social services in direct contact with clients except employees of retirement homes, homes with special regimes, homes for the disabled and relief services (IA), social workers at municipal authorities, employees of the social and legal protection body for children, employees in direct care who provide facilities for children requiring immediate assistance, social workers working at the employment office in the field of care allowance, who come directly to the households of the elderly and disabled, where they carry out social investigations, doctors and secretaries of the assessment service,</li>\n<li>employees of health and social services without direct contact with clients, thus employees of retirement homes, homes for the disabled, homes with special regimes, relief services in residential form, employees of medical facilities.</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n<p>All of them will have to prove themselves with a confirmation from the employer and in the case of Czech Armed Forces and Ministry of Defense employees, by the service card. </p>\n<p>5 - <em>age</em></p>\n<ul><li>people from 75 to 79 of age</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n<p>They will prove themselves at the vaccination site with an ID card and an health insurance card.</p>\n<p>5 - a <em>health condition</em></p>\n<ul><li>chronic patients with higher priority, </li>\n<li>diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin</li>\n<li>obesity (BMI &gt;

So they will follow them as they sign up. If you happen to belong to two groups, for instance you are a pedagogical worker working in a kindergarten (2), but you also suffer from cancer (5), you will be assigned a higher priority (5)</p>\n<p>The principle of the registration assume gradually releasing spots in Central Reservation System for prioritized groups. Following to the plan of vaccine delivery, empty slot will supplement, for example, from a non-priority group according to the registrations that will be available. Empty slots will be supplemented with people from from lesser number score. The algorithm is created, besides overall availability of vaccines, also due to the geolocation and capacity of near vaccination site. </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/how-does-prioritization-system-works"},"changed":"2021-02-25T08:51:18+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-01-31T12:37:16+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-1-Dodatek-3-Prioritizace-c%C3%ADlov%C3%BDch-skupin.pdf","title":"Prioritizace dle skupin (czech only)"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Who will be vaccinated first?","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/who-will-be-vaccinated-first","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Central reservation system","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/central-reservation-system","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Registration and reservation process","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/registration-and-reservation-process","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"I would like to help an elderly to register to the vaccination booking system","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/i-would-help-elderly-register-vaccination-booking-system","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"General vaccination of citizens","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/general-vaccination-citizens","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":" How are the priority groups selected?","value":"Priority is given to medical staff who are in contact with patients with covid-19, followed by groups at risk of severe disease.

The patient will have to provide his/her identity document (ID or passport) and health insurance card. In the waiting area, the patient will become an informational flyer about vaccination and a copy of the Pre-Vaccination Questionnaire. While waiting, he/she will fill and sign the questionnaire. Should the client have came on another date/time, he/she cannot be allowed to get vaccinated and has to leave the vaccination point. If the patient fulfills all requirements, he/she can progress to Checkpoint 2.</p>\n<p>Duration: max. 5 minutes + waiting time</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint 2 - Medical checkup</strong></p>\n<p>After having been registered at Checkpoint 1, the patient progresses to the medical checkup site - a separated area, in which he/she hands the filled and signed questionnaire over to the physician present (or fills and signs it together with the physician while the latter gains the patient's anamnesis). If the physician considers the vaccination appropriate, the patient can progress to the vaccination area itself, if not, he/she has to leave the vaccination point.</p>\n<p>Duration: max. 7 minutes + waiting time</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint 3 -  </strong><strong>Administering of the vaccine</strong></p>\n<p>Within the vaccination area the patient has to follow the vaccinating personnel's advices and prompts.

In the past, the spread of a number of serious diseases could be succesfully reduced by widespread vaccination campaigns, some diseases (e.g. variola or polio) could even get eradicated entirely. That may be possible also in case of COVID-19. The higher the share of those vaccinated within a population, the lower the amount of people who may infect themselves.and, consequently, still spread the disease further.</p>\n<p>How to behave at the vaccination point?</p>\n<ul><li>Follow the personnel's advices and prompts.</li>\n<li>During your entire stay at the vaccination point, keep your mouth and nose covered up with a face mask or a respirator.</li>\n<li>Sanitize your hands, whenever possible.</li>\n<li>Answer the questions you get from the physician while he/she gains your anamnesis truthfully.</li>\n</ul><p>How the vaccination takes place?</p>\n<ul><li>Before the vaccination itself, you will be checked up by a medical, who will ask you some questions regarding your health status and, optionally, your allergies.</li>\n<li>The vaccine is administered intramuscular in the shoulder area.</li>\n<li>After the vaccination, you have to wait 30 minutes, in case you should feel unwell.</li>\n<li>Should you indeed, while still at the vaccination point, suddenly feel unwell, please notify the personnel promptly about that.</li>\n<li>In order to reach full immunisation, it is necessary to administer a second dose as well. In case of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine you will get the second dose 28 days after the first one, in case of the AstraZeneca vaccine this timespan lasts 3 months.</li>\n</ul><p>What should I do after the vaccination?</p>\n<ul><li>At the day of your vaccination, as well as at the day afterwards you should rest and avoid.</li>\n<li>After the first dose the immunisation isn't sufficient yet, you may therefore still infect yourself and should consequently still follow all measures to protect yourself (wearing a face mask, keeping a safety distance, regular hand washing and sanitizing).</li>\n<li>To get the second dose, please come in time exactly at a date you were assigned to.</li>\n</ul><p>Which undesirable side effects can appear after the vaccination?</p>\n<ul><li>The injection site may ache, redden or swell. Furthermore, tiredness, headache, joint/muscular pain as well as (less frequently) engorged lymph nodes, nausea, shiver fits, fever or chills may appear. These effects, however, usually go away within few days, no therapy is needed.</li>\n<li>These effects are quite commonplace and may appear after other vaccinations as well. Serious reactions after a vaccination are very rare.</li>\n<li>It is important to realize that although you may indeed feel uncomfortable due to these effects, COVID-19 itself is able to seriously damage your health - not only can it develop a severe course but also establish long-time aftereffects.</li>\n<li>Should the aforementioned side effects last longer than 3 days or other effects manifest themselves, please inform your GP.</li>\n</ul><p>Vaccination recently constitutes the most suitable option to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and to return to our usual life from the times before - without any countrywide measures and regulations.</p>\n<p>By getting yourself vaccinated, you will protect not only yourself but also your family and your neighborhood.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/how-exactly-will-vaccination-process-look"},"changed":"2021-02-16T22:52:24+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-13T00:03:01+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/letak_informace-pro-ockovane.png","title":"Leták INFORMACE PRO OČKOVANÉ"},{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dotaznik-ockovaneho.png","title":"Dotazník před očkováním"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-1-Dodatek-4-Organizace-o%C4%8Dkovac%C3%AD-m%C3%ADsto.pdf","title":"Organizace očkování na očkovacím místě"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-1-Dodatek-4-P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-2.pdf","title":"Schéma základní organizace a průchod klienta na OČM a VOČM"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-1-Dodatek-5-Po%C5%BEadavky-na-o%C4%8Dkovac%C3%AD-m%C3%ADsto.pdf","title":"Požadavky na očkovací místo"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"How does the prioritization system works?

It will therefore be possible to make reservations immediately (for the 1st and 2nd dose). If the dates are already filled and others are not available (e.g. due to the lack of vaccines), no text message with PIN2 will arrive. But as soon as the date is available, you will receive an \"invitation\" text message. At <a href=\"https://reservatic.com/ockovani\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">reservatic.com/ockovani</a> the reservation can be made with an \"invitation\" message.</p>\n<p>Before January 22nd, after the registration, it was necessary to check every day for the reservation to see if the date would be released (unless the date was immediately available). If you registered before January 22nd and you already have a PIN2, but you have not yet been able to book an appointment, you will also start receiving \"invitation\" text messages from January 22nd, so it is no longer necessary to watch out for free dates every day at <a href=\"https://reservatic.com/ockovani\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">reservatic.com/ockovani</a>.

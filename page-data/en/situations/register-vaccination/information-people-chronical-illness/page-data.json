The vaccine from the company Moderna may also be available, it will be administered directly at the vaccination points. During this phase, the following population groups will get vaccinated:</p>\n<ul><li>elderly aged 80+ (regardless of their recent health state)</li>\n<li>clients of selected elderly &amp; home care facilities as well as their caregivers</li>\n<li>persons treated in after-care &amp; long-term care facilities</li>\n<li>medical workers</li>\n<li>caregivers of COVID-19 positive patients</li>\n<li>sampling sites staff or persons handling potentially dangerous infected materials</li>\n</ul><p>These population groups had been selected due to a high vulnerability of their health state in order to secure the functionality of the health system, facing the threat of lacking the medical personnel.</p>\n<p>Phase 1B (February to May 2021) - Vaccines from more producers should be available. The entire planned network of the vaccination points should be turned on. Gradually, based on the local availability of the vaccines, GP practices should participate as well. At the same time, large capacity vaccination centres should additionally be set up by regional councils, based upon need of the vaccines in that particular region. During this phase, the following population groups will get vaccinated:</p>\n<p><strong>Persons suffering from a selected chronic disease</strong></p>\n<ul><li>diabetes mellitus (treated using insuline or antidiabetics)</li>\n<li>obesity (BMI exceeding 35 kg/m2)</li>\n<li>a severe, chronic lung disease (the patient has to either be treated in a specialised clinical facility or, in case of home care, using oxygen therapy)</li>\n<li>a severe, chronic kidney disease (the patient has to either be treated in a specialised clinical facility or be a member of a dialyse program)</li>\n<li>a severe, chronic liver disease (the patient has to be treated in a specialised clinical facility)</li>\n<li>oncologic disease</li>\n<li>state after an organ or bone marrow transplantation</li>\n<li>a severe, chronic heart disease (the patient has to be treated in a specialised clinical facility) - e.g. coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy</li>\n<li>hypertension (treated using two or more medications)</li>\n<li>a severe neurological or neuromuscular disease affecting the respiratory system</li>\n<li>intellectual insufficiency, conduct disorder or impaired mobility, provided it seriously affects the person's ability to realize and/or follow the epidemiologic measures and regulations set up (sanitizing hands, wearing a face mask, keeping a safe distance)</li>\n<li>a rare genetic disease seriously affecting the immune system (the patient has to be treated in a specialised clinical facility)</li>\n<li>a treatment or other disease seriously affecting the immune system (the patient has to be treated in a specialised clinical facility)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Regular, long-term caregivers of persons suffering of any aforementioned disease</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Elderly (65+), prioritized from the oldest persons</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Persons important to preserve essential functions of the state</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How and when I can register in the vaccination booking system?</strong></p>\n<p>At the websites www.crs.uzis.cz or www.registrace.mzcr.cz (available in Czech only), fill the booking form. The booking form will be available<strong> </strong><strong>from Friday, January 15, 2021 (only elderly 80+ regardless of their health state will be eligible). The opening date for bookings of other persons is not known yet.</strong></p>\n<p>If you are unable to fill the booking form yourself, you may ask a member of your family, if there are none, you may contact your GP or call the 1221 hotline (available with Czech SIM cards/telephone numbers only), the hotline personnel will then carry the booking out for you.</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong> <strong>should I prove my eligibility?</strong></p>\n<p>In the booking form, please select the most appropriate options for your health state. At the vaccination point, you will prove your health state using the health record of your last medical checkup. To prove your identity at the vaccination point please bring your ID with you.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I cannot be vaccinated due to a contraindication?</strong></p>\n<p>In order to ensure the protection of vulnerable persons which, however, due to a contraindication, cannot be vaccinated themselves, a possibility during the Phase IB has been set up for their caregivers to get vaccinated instead. Please note that if a vulnerable person gets vaccinated itself, its caregivers will only be allowed to get vaccinated in the next phase (Phase II). Should you yourself be unable to get vaccinated due to a contraindication and should be, therefore, necessary to get your caregivers vaccinated, please contact your GP.</p>\n<p><strong>Under which circumstances can I get myself vaccinated?</strong></p>\n<p>If unsure whether you may get vaccinated, please contact your GP. The <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/product-information/comirnaty-epar-product-information_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Summary of Product Characteristics of the Pfizer &amp; BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine</a>, elaborated by the European Medicines Agency, contains information on contraindications as well as other general recommendations.</p>\n<p>The physician administering your vaccine dose or your GP should inform you about possible contraindications. The vaccination will not take place if the patient is under 16 or an allergic reaction against any active substance or excipient has been detected. Furthermore, the vaccination will be postponed if the patient suffers from a sudden fever or another sudden infectious illness.</p>\n<p>Due to lack of data, pregnant women may consider getting vaccinated only if possible benefits will outweigh any potential risks for the mother and her fetus. It is yet unknown, whether the vaccines excrete into the breast milk or not, whereas animal studies do not suggest any direct or indirect reproductive toxicity effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Which health state is ideal for getting the vaccine administered?</strong></p>\n<p>In persons who suffer from a sudden severe fever or a sudden infection, the vaccination should be postponed. However, the existence of a mild infection or low-grade fever does not constitute a reason for postponing the vaccination. If in doubt, please consult your GP.</p>\n<p><strong>You don't have to test yourself before getting vaccinated.</strong></p>\n<p>It is not necessary to undergo a COVID-19 test before getting vaccinated. The vaccination of a person suffering from COVID-19 cannot as such lead to any damage to that person's health.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>What if I cannot - due to severity of my health state or impaired mobility - get to the vaccination point?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see the page <a href=\"/situace/registrace-na-ockovani/ockovani-imobilnich-pacientu\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Očkování imobilních pacientů\">Vaccination of immobile patients</a>.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/information-people-chronical-illness"},"changed":"2021-03-02T15:31:12+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-17T01:20:31+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://pacientskeorganizace.mzcr.cz/index.php?pg=home&aid=95","title":"Information on COVID-19 vaccination for persons with a chronical illness (in Czech only)"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/tiskove-centrum-mz/ministerstvo-zdravotnictvi-spusti-centralni-rezervacni-system/","title":"Ministry of Health Press Release: The Ministry starts the Central Reservation System (in Czech only)"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How vaccination works?

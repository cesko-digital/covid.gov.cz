In the phase 2 vaccination site is strengthened with GP offices. Ministry of Health is responsible for vaccination centres (serving as a distributive point) management, standard vaccination centres are the responsibility of regional coordinators of vaccination.</p>\n<p>Implementation of GP offices into the site of vaccination points is conditioned by the sufficient number of vaccine doses delivered and the ability of GPs to order vaccine doses from their distributor. GPs are the only subject which is not obliged to use the Central Registration System.</p>\n<p>Except for vaccination centres (distributive points), the Central Registration System encompasses other vaccination points (e.g., Health centres). These points will start the vaccination after receiving vaccine deliveries as scheduled.</p>\n<p>Vaccination site is divided into 6 groups.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Vaccination centres (serving as distribution points)</strong></p>\n<p>Designed for storage and usage of all possible vaccines including Comirnaty by Pfizer/BionTech requiring storage temperatures below -70°C. The list of the centres includes especially large medical facilities equipped as requested. The task of these centres is also to distribute the vaccines to smaller vaccine points (pharmacies, health institutes). Each centre disposes of at least one mobile vaccination team.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Standard vaccination centres</strong></p>\n<p>The list of standard vaccination centres includes granted medical facilities except for GP offices. One provider can vaccinate in multiple locations. In case many vaccination points are located in one place, it is used the term “vaccination stations”. Standard vaccination centres also can set up mobile vaccination teams.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Large capacity vaccination centres</strong></p>\n<p>A special type of vaccination centre located outside the standard area of a medical facility designed for vaccination of large volume of individuals. The help of external staff (medical workers, volunteers, army) is expected during the operation of large-capacity centres.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Mobile vaccination teams</strong></p>\n<p>The task of mobile teams is to provide vaccination for disabled individuals. It is mandatory to set up at least one mobile team per region – this is the responsibility of vaccination centres specified above.</p>\n<p><strong>5. GP offices</strong></p>\n<p>In the first phase, GPs are helping their patients to register into the Central Registration System. Phase two counts with vaccination also in GP offices. The Central Registration System will not be used in the second phase by GPs, they will manage vaccination according to their best practice like vaccination for other diseases. GP is obliged to issue vaccination certificate after successful vaccination of given individual.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Other vaccination points</strong></p>\n<p>Private health care providers can voluntarily join the process of vaccination. If you – as a medical facility – want to join the system, please do not hesitate to contact your regional coordinator for vaccination and follow the recommendations.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/list-vaccination-centers"},"changed":"2021-02-15T18:49:12+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-15T18:49:12+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-1-Dodatek-1-P%C5%99ehled-DO%C4%8CM.pdf","title":"Seznam distribučních očkovacích míst"},{"uri":"https://www.vozp.cz/spoluproticovidu","title":"VOZP informuje o průběhu očkování"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How vaccination works?

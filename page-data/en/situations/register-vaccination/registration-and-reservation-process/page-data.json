In the case of vaccination point/place change, a new registration is requested.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>After receiving an SMS reminder with PIN2, you have 72 hours to finish your reservation on the website <a href=\"https://reservatic.com/ockovani\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">reservatic.com/ockovani</a>. After 72 hours, your PIN2 expire and you will not be able to complete your reservation. <strong>Please be aware that expiration of the PIN2 means that you will not be able to finish neither your reservation, nor your registration.</strong> The reason is not to hinder the registration process by long waiting times for completing the reservation.

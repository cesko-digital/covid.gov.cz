In the case of immobile patients who cannot come to the vaccination center, the Ministry of Health, in agreement with the Association of General Practitioners and regional coordinators, recommends vaccinating these persons at a time when vaccines are available that are less prone to depreciation caused by transportation and storing in a stage of a deep freeze. Such vaccines are, for instance, AstraZeneca or Johnson &amp; Johnson. Vaccination will thus take place through the practician according to the individual condition of the patient, <strong>not through the Central Reservation System</strong>. The doctor will agree with the patient on the most suitable method of vaccination.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if a person is unable to come to the vaccination site for serious health reasons, it is likely that, for logistical reasons, they will not be able to be vaccinated with Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. The person should contact the general practitioner and agree with him on the procedure that will be most suitable for him. Orders will <strong>not be placed through the Central Reservation System.</strong></p>\n<p>From 26. January, Brno launched the possibility for immobile seniors (80+) to register on the number 771 135 452 (it works on working days from 8 am to 12 noon and from 1 pm to 3 pm), and vaccinations will be given at home by a mobile vaccination team as soon as this will allow the availability of vaccines. <strong>More details can be found on</strong><strong> the <a href=\"https://koronavirus.brno.cz/en/immobile-seniors-can-get-vaccinated-at-home-two-vaccination-teams-at-the-disposal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">city's website.</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/vaccination-immobile-patients"},"changed":"2021-02-27T19:19:23+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-01-31T14:37:57+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"How does the prioritization system works?

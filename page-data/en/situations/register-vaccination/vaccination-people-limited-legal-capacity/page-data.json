","content":{"processed":"<p>For vaccination against covid-19, the same rules apply to the approval of consent to vaccination as for any vaccination before an emergency period. No different rules are issued for vaccination against covid-19.</p>\n<p>For example, if a person with limited legal capacity whose vaccination is approved by the guardian is able to formulate his or her disagreement, the staff cannot ignore it. The medical staff can not act strictly due to the guardian's opinion and the guardian must proceed as in any other case of a fundamental conflict between the guardian's will and the guardian. (cf. in particular §100 para. 1, para. 2 of the Civil Code, Title II Part 2, Section 2 of the Civil Code, § 2638 para. 2, civil code; § 34 para. 7, § 35 and subsequent Act on Health Services). There is no change in this legislation and all participants are obliged to proceed in the same way as in the pre-emergency period.</p>\n<p>We recommend to guardians and guardianship councils who are not sure of the correct procedure to increase awareness, for example, <a href=\"https://www.ochrance.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/Letaky/Ockovani_klientu_s_omezenou_svepravnosti.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">the infographic of the Office of the Public Defender of Rights</a> (only in Czech) to vaccinate clients with limited legal capacity in residential social services.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/vaccination-people-limited-legal-capacity"},"changed":"2021-02-27T19:11:50+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-18T20:10:17+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.ochrance.cz/aktualne/tiskove-zpravy-2021/klienti-socialnich-sluzeb-somezenou-svepravnosti-maji-pravo-na-uplne-a-pristupne-inf/","title":"Informace na webu Kanceláře veřejného ochránce práv"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia","drupal_internal__tid":"33"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-02-11T00:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"},"situation":[{"id":"328435ed-3a73-570b-83d7-1bcf033aaaa9","title":"Who will be vaccinated first?","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/who-will-be-vaccinated-first"}},{"id":"82205f40-8983-5234-931a-829a91238c2b","title":"General vaccination of citizens","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/general-vaccination-citizens"}},{"id":"c659aa27-6c06-5c0a-843d-8695baec3de6","title":"List of vaccination centers","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/list-vaccination-centers"}},{"id":"65133f49-3e9c-5ceb-8af6-020f168826fa","title":"Central reservation system","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/central-reservation-system"}},{"id":"7a7cba92-75e5-5ee7-8e9b-4d98a5f4f81a","title":"Information for people with a chronical illness","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/information-people-chronical-illness"}},{"id":"e87bf863-83d7-5242-8f4e-f9461b5896c2","title":"How does the prioritization system works?

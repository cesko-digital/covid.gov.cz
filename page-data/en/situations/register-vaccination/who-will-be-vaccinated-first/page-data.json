In it is the first phase that risk groups and medical staff will be vaccinated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Vaccination is voluntary and paid by the health insurance company. No one should be forced to be vaccinated.</strong></p>\n<p>I. phase itself is split into A) and B). Starts 15.1.2021 and shall by ended 28.2.2021. The schedule may be extended depending on the availability of vaccines. Phase 1B is scheduled to run from February to June 2021. </p>\n<h2>PHASE 1A</h2>\n<p>Vaccination of the most threatened groups of the population will take place in order to prevent of the growth of morbidity and mortality in the elderly (80+) and in institutionalized persons, protection of designated medical staff and persons providing care for selected social service providers.</p>\n<p>You can find a list of who it is specifically in a life situation describing it (<a href=\"/situace/registrace-na-ockovani/jak-funguje-prioritizacni-system\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Jak funguje prioritizační systém?\">prioritization process.</a>) </p>\n<p>In phase 1A, some of these groups will have to register into the Central Reservation System. Namely, seniors over 80 years of age who are not clients of any social or medical facility.</p>\n<p>Employees or clients regarding the above points will not have to register for vaccination, this applies to clients if they are permanently accommodated there. They get it at home facility.</p>\n<p>The above groups were chosen with regard to the high degree of threat to their health and to ensure the functionality of the health system in the Czech Republic from the point of view of the threat of a shortage of medical staff.</p>\n<p>The aim is to vaccianate 70% of this group (1A), and if the goal is not achieved, it can only be due to insufficient interest (vaccination is voluntary).</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline of 1A </strong></p>\n<p>From 15 January, seniors will be able to register in the Central Reservation System, either on their own behalf or with the assistance.</p>\n<p>From 26 January, medical staff and persons providing care with selected social service providers can register.</p>\n<p>These two data do not apply to medical staff and seniors who will be vaccinated in health facilities (either they are employed or patients / clients).</p>\n<p>Medical and social facilities in which vaccinations will take place apart from the Central Registration System are obliged to report in advance how many people need to be vaccinated and then report each vaccination to the ISIN (Infectious disease information system). This is to control the handling of the vaccines and to protect the health of the patient, so that one of the vaccine doses is not given to them twice. Currently vaccines from the Pfizer/BioNTech consortium is now available, which is vaccinated at vaccination sites (31 sites in the Czech Republic in total), and possibly as well as a vaccine from Moderna, which is vaccinated directly at the vaccination sites. Thus, vaccination in phase 1A begins with the use of these vaccines.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>VACCINATION OF MEDICAL STAFF IN PHASE 1A</strong></p>\n<p>Objednání k očkování v této skupině probíhá dvěma způsoby:<br />\n1) mimo Centrální rezervační systém, jde-li o pracovníky očkovacího místa (vč.<br />\nstudentů lékařských fakult, dobrovolníků a dalších) či osoby podílející se na péči o<br />\nCOVID-pozitivní osoby a osoby pracující na odběrových místech a s potenciálně<br />\ninfekčním materiálem (zvláště, nejsou-li tyto osoby vedeny v Národním registru<br />\nzdravotnických pracovníků),<br />\n2) prostřednictvím Centrálního rezervačního systému v případě pracovníků<br />\npracujících mimo očkovací místa (praktičtí lékaři, ambulantní specialisté,<br />\nfarmaceuti, pracovníci domácí zdravotní péče a další). Validace osob v této<br />\nskupině probíhá skrze Národní registr zdravotnických pracovníků.</p>\n<p>There are two ways how to order vaccinations in this group:</p>\n<p>1) Apart from the Central Reservation System, in the case of vaccination center staff (incl. medical students, volunteers and others) or persons involved in the care of COVID-positive people and people working at sampling points and with potential infectious material (especially if these persons are not listed in the National Register medical staff),</p>\n<p>2) Via the Central Reservation System in the case of employees working outside vaccination centers (praticioners, outpatient specialists, pharmacists, home health care workers and others). Validation of persons in this group takes place through the National Register of medical staff.</p>\n<p>Prioritization for vaccination within the group of health professionals in phase 1A takes place due to age (preference for older medical staff)</p>\n<p>With the availability of the vaccine in the practitioner's office, it will be possible to complete vaccination also in these facilities. The groups prioritization remains same. Due to the high risk of medical occupation due to the high propability of exposure to a new type of coronavirus, vaccination is maximal the number of healthcare professionals at the earliest possible stage of vaccination is necessary.</p>\n<h2><strong>PHASE 1B</strong></h2>\n<p>Once the vaccination of personnel from phase 1A will be done, another phase will follow. That already includes several different groups, so a certain prioritization will be set. Therefore, you will be able to log in to the system and fill in your data (protected according to GDPR). Based on them, your point score will be calculated and the availability of vaccines will also be taken into account. According to these indicators, you will be asked to register for one of the offered dates. You will not be able to choose preffered date.</p>\n<p><strong>1B phase is scheduled from February to May 2021</strong>, but once again it will depened on the sufficient availability of the vaccines. Scheduled time period may therefore extend. </p>\n<p>A particular list of groups regarding phase IB can be found again in <a href=\"/situace/registrace-na-ockovani/jak-funguje-prioritizacni-system\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Jak funguje prioritizační systém?\">prioritization</a>.</p>\n<p>Phase 1B ends when 70% of the vaccination of priority groups (1B) will be given or due to lack of interest. At the same time, there will be enough vaccines and vaccination sites available to start vaccination of all persons who require vaccination, without prioritization.</p>\n<p>By logging in to the Central Reservation System, you express your free will to be vaccinated. Vaccination will be completely voluntary. The system will also generate confirmation of vaccination, including support for mobile devices and compatibility with EU and WHO standards.</p>\n<p>Phase 1B is characterized by the availability of vaccines from multiple manufacturers. Vaccination will be carried out by the maximum amount of established vaccination sites (DOČM - Distribution vaccination site, OČM - vaccination site and VOČM - Large-capacity vaccination sites) and, depending on the availability of vaccines, general practitioners will be gradually involved. At the same time, large-capacity vaccination sites will be set up for the general public based on the needs of the regions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/who-will-be-vaccinated-first"},"changed":"2021-02-03T13:52:08+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-01-31T13:21:10+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-4-Dodatek-2-Certifik%C3%A1t-o-proveden%C3%AD-o%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1n%C3%AD.pdf","title":"Náhled očkovacího certifikátu (czech only)"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Metodick%C3%BD-pokyn-kampan%C4%9B-o%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1n%C3%AD-Pl%C3%A1n-proveden%C3%AD.pdf","title":"Metodický pokyn pro očkovací kampaň a Plán provedení (czech only)"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-4-IT-podpora.pdf","title":"IT Podpora očkování (czech only)"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prezentace_Centr%C3%A1ln%C3%AD-rezerva%C4%8Dn%C3%AD-syst%C3%A9m.pdf","title":"Prezentace MZČR k rezervaci v Centrálním registračním systému (czech only)"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"How does the prioritization system works?

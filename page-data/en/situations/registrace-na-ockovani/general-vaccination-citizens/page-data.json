Vaccination of these people is scheduled for May 2021 and should end during 2022. The exact date will depend on the supply of the vaccine.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaccinations will be voluntary and paid for by the health insurance company.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>After registering in the CRS at </strong><a href=\"https://crs.uzis.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\"><strong>crs.uzis.cz</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a href=\"https://registrace.mzcr.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\"><strong>registrace.mzcr.cz </strong></a><strong>(both links available only in the Czech language)</strong>, you will be given a deadline concerning the occupancy of the vaccination site and the supply of vaccines. It can therefore be assigned to you immediately upon registration, or you will receive a confirmation of registration and the deadline will be sent to you later. At this stage, the involvement of general practitioners is already planned. The GPs will not be obliged to use the CRS as it is a common practice and they already have adapted their registration systems. However, they will also be obliged to report all vaccinated persons to ISIN-OČKO on the day of vaccination.</p>\n<p>Some groups will either be permanently excluded from vaccination due to their medical condition or will suffer from a short-term contraindication that will exclude them from vaccination. The second group will be able to be vaccinated as soon as the short-term contraindication (e.g. fever) has passed.</p>\n<p>By logging in to the Central Reservation System, or your practitioner, you express your free will to be vaccinated. This system will also subsequently create a certificate of vaccination, including support for mobile devices and compatibility with EU and WHO standards.</p>\n<p>Phase II will end when the minimum vaccination coverage is 60% of the target population and vaccination against covid-19 becomes a common type of vaccination against infectious disease.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/general-vaccination-citizens"},"changed":"2021-02-01T22:07:58+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2021-02-01T22:07:58+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-4-Dodatek-2-Certifik%C3%A1t-o-proveden%C3%AD-o%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1n%C3%AD.pdf","title":"Náhled certifikátu provedeného očkování"},{"uri":"https://www.mzcr.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P%C5%99%C3%ADloha-4-IT-podpora.pdf","title":"IT podpora očkování"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Register for vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"maps_ugc"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Manual for registration","path":{"alias":"/situations/ockovani/manual-registration","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Central reservation system","path":{"alias":"/situations/registrace-na-ockovani/central-reservation-system","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"From registration to vaccination","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/registration-vaccination","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"I would like to help an elderly to register to the vaccination booking system","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/i-would-help-elderly-register-vaccination-booking-system","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Who will be vaccinated first?","path":{"alias":"/situations/register-vaccination/who-will-be-vaccinated-first","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Who should not get vaccinated?","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/who-should-not-get-vaccinated","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Information about available vaccines","path":{"alias":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/information-about-available-vaccines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How vaccination works?

Restaurant gardens are also closed. However, from 4:59 to 21:00 it is <strong>possible to have an open takeout window</strong> and sell takeaway food. Food deliveries can work all day.</p>\n<p><strong>The exception</strong> is restaurants that are not for the public - these are typically employee canteens or catering providers of health and social services (e.g. canteens in sick, elderly homes) or prisons. <strong>The second exception</strong> are the restaurants in accommodation facilities, which provide food to their guests (e.g. breakfast for hotel guests) – these can operate from 5:00 to 20:59.</p>\n<p><strong>Drinking alcohol is prohibited in the area of restaurant establishments, their surroundings and in all public places</strong> (e.g. parks, stops, housing estates, squares, shops, etc.).</p>\n<p>When you are <strong>buying takeaway food</strong>, have your mouth and nose covered at all times, keep at least 2 meters of distance from other customers and restaurant staff, use disinfectant and prefer card payment. The more we protect ourselves, the sooner we can go back to eating in restaurants.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops/mode-operation"},"changed":"2020-12-28T22:53:49+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-10T20:46:15+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"food_bank"},"situation_type":{"name":"Restaurants, bars, coffee shops","path":{"alias":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"local_dining"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Company canteens","path":{"alias":"/situations/employment/company-canteens","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Accommodations","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/accommodations","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Outside seating, terraces, indoor gardens","path":{"alias":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops/outside-seating-terraces-indoor-gardens","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-12-27T23:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Restaurants, bars, coffee shops","path":{"alias":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"local_dining"},"situation":[{"id":"d6c7c4b8-9986-5448-b6d7-f7918c9eb0b6","title":"Mode of operation","path":{"alias":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops/mode-operation"}},{"id":"cd6c3677-e149-5046-bae0-f153e7f8434e","title":"Outside seating, terraces, indoor gardens","path":{"alias":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops/outside-seating-terraces-indoor-gardens"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops/mode-operation","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/restaurants-bars-coffee-shops","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/restaurace-bary-kavarny/rezim-provozu"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

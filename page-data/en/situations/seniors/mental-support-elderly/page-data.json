The general advice is to go outside as little as possible - go out only for the most necessary purchases or to the doctor, always with a face mask on. It is better to skip visiting relatives for a while. Although it's not easy, try to keep in touch with your children, grandchildren and other relatives or friends, by phone. Try to ask someone from your area to pick-up groceries, medicine at the pharmacy, or even walking the dog.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are some basic tips on how to handle a pandemic:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you feel nervous, upset, or confused, that's fine. These feelings are a completely natural reaction to a new, unknown situation.</li>\n<li>Talk about your feelings - call your children, grandchildren, or friends.</li>\n<li>If you feel that your feelings are difficult to manage, contact one of the helplines, their trained staff will advise you on what to do in difficult situations. Crisis lines are also available for regular conversations. You can find a list of them below.</li>\n<li>Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Seniors are one of the most vulnerable groups, so it is only natural that they need help. Trained volunteers can help with picking-up groceries, medicine, or even walking your dog. Volunteers are provided by some municipal offices.</li>\n<li>Do not underestimate the situation, but try to avoid panic. Limit the time you spend reading the newspaper and watching the news. You can do better for yourself if you read a book, solve a crossword puzzle, or watch your favorite movie.</li>\n<li>Try to follow a proper lifestyle - try to sleep enough, eat quality food, keep your mind busy by reading and other activities - ideas can be found in the brochure How to Survive Quarantine and Stay Active on Body and Spirit?

Accommodation services can only be provided for the purpose of business travel (business trips) to those who have an ordered work obligation, in quarantine or isolation, foreigners before they leave the Czech Republic or foreigners who have a business permit in the Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>Personal and recreational visits aren't possible.</p>\n<p>If an accommodation service is operating, it is necessary to wear a mask when in a shared space. During your stay, follow all hygienic rules and try to stay in your room whenever possible.</p>\n<p>The hotel operator must carry out a routine disinfection of all common areas (mainly door handles, hallways, railings, elevators, bathrooms…). It is also important to pay extra attention to room cleaning and when cleaning towels and bed covers. This will significantly reduce the risk of infection for customers and employees. And the sooner we can return to hotels in regular service.</p>\n<p>Restaurants in accommodation services have an exception from the ban on the presence of the public in restaurants, if they are offering food for accommodated guests. They can be open between 6:00 and 20:00.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Am I obliged to wear a face mask in my hotel room?","value":"No."},{"question":"Can I book a hotel room for a business trip purposes?","value":"Yes."},{"question":"As a foreigner with work permission in the Czech Republic, am I able to book and stay in a hotel room?","value":"Yes."},{"question":"Can I finish my hotel stay if it had started before the governmental regulations took place?","value":"Yes."},{"question":"Being a hotel guest, can I stay in a hotel during my self-isolation?","value":"Yes, we advise you to follow specific hotel conditions."},{"question":"Can I eat in a hotel restaurant during my stay?","value":"Yes, please be aware that opening hours of the restaurant are limited from 6:00 to 20:00."},{"question":"Can I stay in my cottage or country house?","value":"Yes, you can stay in your own cottage or house.

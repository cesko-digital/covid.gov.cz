You can enter the branch by a maximum of 2 people at the same time. Members of the same household are exempt from this rule. It is not possible to go to the bank during the night curfew between 9 PM and 4:59AM.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>written or telephone communication should take precedence</strong>. You can also do many things online. For example, it is advised to use <strong>internet banking</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Only urgent matters should be held in person</strong>. Prior to a personal visit to a bank or insurance company, it is a good idea to first call in, check whether the matter can be resolved in writing or via the Internet, and possibly <strong>arrange a specific date for the visit</strong>.</p>\n<p>Wear a face mask at the bank or insurance company at all times and keep a safe distance from other customers and employees. Before entering, disinfect<strong> your hands</strong>. If you know that you will be signing something, it is good to <strong>bring your own pen</strong> so that you do not touch objects unnecessarily on the spot.</p>\n<p>If possible, give preference to <strong>contactless payment</strong> (transfers, card payment) before paying in cash. Contactless payment can help reduce the risk of infection.</p>\n<p>You can find the rules and possibilities of the state compensation in the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/en/situations/compensation\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Compensation</a> topic.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance"},"changed":"2021-01-04T21:04:05+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T14:12:32+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"attach_money"},"situation_type":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Hygienic measures in the workplace","path":{"alias":"/situations/employment/hygienic-measures-workplace","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Indoor","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/indoor","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/services","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-01-04T22:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"},"situation":[{"id":"29bf3a0d-146c-59ea-8ff1-14e061c786af","title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail"}},{"id":"364ce4d7-7f46-5870-933d-7481ad1a5903","title":"Post Office","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/post-office"}},{"id":"93bd360a-12b7-5bfc-bf4d-1fe6a9d8c55e","title":"Shopping","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping"}},{"id":"005ea0c7-f646-5875-9ae1-6ed83c1348f4","title":"Services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/services"}},{"id":"16ca4b85-f3dc-5394-9498-4492601ef573","title":"Banks and insurance","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance"}},{"id":"5124cb25-494a-5acc-8bb8-f294cdacb405","title":"Health resorts","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/health-resorts"}},{"id":"4b52758c-592a-52e0-adc9-f33ab3b2fa65","title":" Shopping malls","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping-malls"}},{"id":"7b0b36ea-2872-5c56-91ce-49b05adc1f04","title":"Wholesale","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/wholesale"}},{"id":"25e0fe42-415a-51e7-a1f6-bb97e941560d","title":"Repair shops and after-sale services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/repair-shops-and-after-sale-services"}},{"id":"e5f17c29-fcab-5239-bce1-8d73b8409188","title":"Delivery and courier services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/delivery-and-courier-services"}},{"id":"8e00af9e-fe1f-5a8b-81da-ebb4eac90ea8","title":"Driver's education","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/drivers-education"}},{"id":"a00d85fe-42c6-5545-af85-560415c65382","title":"E-shop","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/e-shop"}},{"id":"6eef451a-c1e7-5e7c-b58a-19b2aa8bb8b3","title":"Markets, farmers markets","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets"}},{"id":"a547b76c-f1e0-5ef5-9bea-b2c2c1d285d4","title":"Theatre, film and other artistic performances","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/theatre-film-and-other-artistic-performances"}},{"id":"4d5d7114-ee63-5763-ba5b-397ac188c89a","title":"Accommodations","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/accommodations"}},{"id":"ba3a6dc8-ca5f-565c-82ad-ac0f233c36ed","title":"Photographers","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/photographers"}},{"id":"8044afbe-d49d-5af1-8a1e-985c64bd24bd","title":"Funeral services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/funeral-services"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/shops-and-services","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/obchod-sluzby/banky-pojistovny"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

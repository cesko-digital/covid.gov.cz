If you develop symptoms of a respiratory illness (especially cough or difficulty breathing) or fever before leaving, you should consult your doctor whether you should go for tests or postpone your stay.

It is also important to take <strong>extra care to clean the rooms</strong> and handle towels and bedding. This will significantly reduce the risk of infection (for both residents and employees). We also recommend regular ventilation of the areas where possible.</p>\n<p>There can be a maximum of 10 people at a time in <strong>indoor pools, saunas</strong>, etc. The exception is members of one household.

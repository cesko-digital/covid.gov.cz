The only exception being markets and stands selling specific products. ","content":{"processed":"<h2><strong>Rules and recommendations</strong></h2>\n<p>Market stalls, <strong>markets</strong> and farmers' markets <strong>are prohibited</strong>. The only <strong>exceptions are markets and stalls with selected products</strong>. Specifically, only fresh or processed fruits, vegetables, milk and dairy products, meat and meat products, eggs, bakery and confectionery products, honey and honey <strong>products</strong> can be sold on the markets, and only if they are <strong>produced in the Czech Republic</strong>.</p>\n<p>The ban on the sale of products in stalls does not apply to mobile markets (selling drugs) and food trucks also does not apply in places where it is not possible to buy goods in another store (typically in smaller villages without shops).</p>\n<p>If this exemption is applied and the markets take place, <strong>increased hygiene measures</strong> must be observed. <strong>Consumption of food and drink is also prohibited</strong> where markets take place. There can be <strong>1 person on the market for 15m ^ 2 at a time</strong> and without distance of 2m a group of <strong>max. 6 people</strong> will be possible. With the exception of members of the common household. Stalls, tables or other sales areas must be located <strong>min. 4 meters apart</strong>.</p>\n<p>Although markets take place outside, there is a large concentration of people in a small space, so it was necessary to temporarily reduce this form of sale in order to slow down the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, there are certain exceptions to the general ban - it is possible to sell local products from Czech farmers. If you go to the markets<strong>, keep your safe distance and wear a face mask</strong> at all times. If you buy some food or drinks, take them and consume them ideally at home.</p>\n<p>All other forms of stall and market sales are prohibited.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets"},"changed":"2020-11-22T21:12:01+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T21:31:04+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"emoji_nature"},"situation_type":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Outdoor","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/outdoor","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Christmas events","path":{"alias":"/situations/current-events-christmas/christmas-events","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-17T23:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"},"situation":[{"id":"29bf3a0d-146c-59ea-8ff1-14e061c786af","title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail"}},{"id":"364ce4d7-7f46-5870-933d-7481ad1a5903","title":"Post Office","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/post-office"}},{"id":"93bd360a-12b7-5bfc-bf4d-1fe6a9d8c55e","title":"Shopping","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping"}},{"id":"005ea0c7-f646-5875-9ae1-6ed83c1348f4","title":"Services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/services"}},{"id":"16ca4b85-f3dc-5394-9498-4492601ef573","title":"Banks and insurance","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance"}},{"id":"5124cb25-494a-5acc-8bb8-f294cdacb405","title":"Health resorts","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/health-resorts"}},{"id":"4b52758c-592a-52e0-adc9-f33ab3b2fa65","title":" Shopping malls","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping-malls"}},{"id":"7b0b36ea-2872-5c56-91ce-49b05adc1f04","title":"Wholesale","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/wholesale"}},{"id":"25e0fe42-415a-51e7-a1f6-bb97e941560d","title":"Repair shops and after-sale services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/repair-shops-and-after-sale-services"}},{"id":"e5f17c29-fcab-5239-bce1-8d73b8409188","title":"Delivery and courier services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/delivery-and-courier-services"}},{"id":"8e00af9e-fe1f-5a8b-81da-ebb4eac90ea8","title":"Driver's education","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/drivers-education"}},{"id":"a00d85fe-42c6-5545-af85-560415c65382","title":"E-shop","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/e-shop"}},{"id":"6eef451a-c1e7-5e7c-b58a-19b2aa8bb8b3","title":"Markets, farmers markets","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets"}},{"id":"a547b76c-f1e0-5ef5-9bea-b2c2c1d285d4","title":"Theatre, film and other artistic performances","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/theatre-film-and-other-artistic-performances"}},{"id":"4d5d7114-ee63-5763-ba5b-397ac188c89a","title":"Accommodations","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/accommodations"}},{"id":"ba3a6dc8-ca5f-565c-82ad-ac0f233c36ed","title":"Photographers","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/photographers"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/shops-and-services","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/obchod-sluzby/trhy-farmarske-trhy"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

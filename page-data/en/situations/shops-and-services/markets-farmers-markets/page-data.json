","content":{"processed":"<p><strong>Rules and recommendations</strong></p>\n<p>Sales in stands, marketplaces and farmers markets are banned. The only exception being markets and stands selling specific products. The exeptions being markets selling fresh or processed fruit, vegetables, milk, dairy products, meat, meat products, eggs, baked goods, honey and products made from honey and only those that were made in the Czech republic.</p>\n<p>The ban on sales from stands, markets and mobile businesses selling grocery and drugstore products does not apply in municipalities, where these products can't be bought in another store (generally in smaller villages without a local shop).</p>\n<p>If the conditions for this exception are met, heightened hygienic regulations must be met. It isn't allowed to consume food or drink in the places where the market is being held. There can be max. 20 people per 400 square meters and the stands must be at least 4 meters away from each other.</p>\n<p>Despite the markets happening outside in the open air, there will be a lot of people in a small area which is why they were closed in an attempt to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. Despite this, there are certain exceptions to this rule- notably the sale of local products from Czech farmers among other reasons to support these products and their producers. If you visit these markets, wear a mask and social distance. If you buy food or drink, consume it somewhere else, ideally at home.</p>\n<p>All other sale in stands and markets is not permitted. Christmas markets will not be allowed.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets"},"changed":"2020-11-22T21:12:01+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T21:31:04+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"emoji_nature"},"situation_type":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Outdoor","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/outdoor","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Christmas events","path":{"alias":"/situations/current-events-christmas/christmas-events","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-17T23:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"},"situation":[{"id":"29bf3a0d-146c-59ea-8ff1-14e061c786af","title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail"}},{"id":"364ce4d7-7f46-5870-933d-7481ad1a5903","title":"Post Office","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/post-office"}},{"id":"93bd360a-12b7-5bfc-bf4d-1fe6a9d8c55e","title":"Shopping","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping"}},{"id":"005ea0c7-f646-5875-9ae1-6ed83c1348f4","title":"Services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/services"}},{"id":"16ca4b85-f3dc-5394-9498-4492601ef573","title":"Banks and insurance","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance"}},{"id":"5124cb25-494a-5acc-8bb8-f294cdacb405","title":"Health resorts","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/health-resorts"}},{"id":"4b52758c-592a-52e0-adc9-f33ab3b2fa65","title":" Shopping malls","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping-malls"}},{"id":"7b0b36ea-2872-5c56-91ce-49b05adc1f04","title":"Wholesale","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/wholesale"}},{"id":"25e0fe42-415a-51e7-a1f6-bb97e941560d","title":"Repair shops and after-sale services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/repair-shops-and-after-sale-services"}},{"id":"e5f17c29-fcab-5239-bce1-8d73b8409188","title":"Delivery and courier services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/delivery-and-courier-services"}},{"id":"8e00af9e-fe1f-5a8b-81da-ebb4eac90ea8","title":"Driver's education","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/drivers-education"}},{"id":"a00d85fe-42c6-5545-af85-560415c65382","title":"E-shop","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/e-shop"}},{"id":"6eef451a-c1e7-5e7c-b58a-19b2aa8bb8b3","title":"Markets, farmers markets","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets"}},{"id":"a547b76c-f1e0-5ef5-9bea-b2c2c1d285d4","title":"Theatre, film and other artistic performances","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/theatre-film-and-other-artistic-performances"}},{"id":"4d5d7114-ee63-5763-ba5b-397ac188c89a","title":"Accommodations","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/accommodations"}},{"id":"ba3a6dc8-ca5f-565c-82ad-ac0f233c36ed","title":"Photographers","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/photographers"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/shops-and-services","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/obchod-sluzby/trhy-farmarske-trhy"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

When selling or shopping on a market you have to follow all rules and hygienic measures. Remember COVID-19 is still around and can strike again if we do not control it with our behaviour.</p>\n<p>There can be <strong>1 person on the market for 15m^2 at a time</strong> and without a distance of 2m a group of <strong>max. 10 people</strong> will be possible. With the exception of members of the common household. Stalls, tables or other <strong>sales areas</strong> must be located <strong>min. 4 meters apart</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Consumption of food and drink is also prohibited</strong> where markets take place. No mulled wine on this years' Christmas markets. You can order food and beverages takeaway and consume it somewhere outside of the market, where the concentration of the people is lower.</p>\n<p>It will not be possible to sit or stay on a market since tables and benches or chairs are not allowed. This together with the consumption ban ensures a lower amount of average time people spend on the market, therefore reducing the concentration.</p>\n<p>Although markets take place outside, there is a large concentration of people in a small space, if you go to the markets<strong>, keep your safe distance and wear a face mask</strong> at all times. If you buy some food or drinks, take them and consume them ideally at home.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets"},"changed":"2020-11-29T18:32:08+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T21:31:04+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"emoji_nature"},"situation_type":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Outdoor","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/outdoor","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Christmas events","path":{"alias":"/situations/current-events-christmas/christmas-events","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Can i eat a sausage or \"langoš\" at a market?","value":"No. Because of the large concentration of people on the market, consumption of food and beverages is therefore prohibited."},{"question":"Can I sell mead or mulled wine on the market?","value":"Yes.

They work in limited mode. An overview of post office opening hours can be found <a href=\"https://www.postaonline.cz/en/vyhledat-pobocku\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">here</a>. It is also possible to still use the <a href=\"https://www.czechpoint.cz/public/kontaktni-misto/zakladni-informace-kmvs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Czech POINT</a> service.</p>\n<p><strong>A group of up to 2 people</strong> (with the exception of members of one household) will be allowed at the post office. It must be provided that the size of the branch allows it to keep 2 m distances. If the size of the branch does not allow it, <strong>2 m spacing must be maintained</strong> and the management queues must be adapted accordingly.</p>\n<p>You must <strong>wear a face mask</strong> at all times. Wear it even if you have mail delivered to your home. <strong>Please take your own pen</strong> if you are signing something. </p>\n<p>The post office is not governed by the Retail Restrictions Regulation, but is obliged to ensure appropriate hygienic measures, which may be different, e.g. according to the size of the branch. We recommend following the regulations of a specific branch.</p>\n<p><strong>Disinfect your hands</strong> before entering the post office building or picking up your mail. For greater safety, you can open the delivered goods outdoors so that the risk of transmission of the disease is as low as possible.</p>\n<h2><strong>Delivery</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>The home delivery of letters and parcels continues</strong>. If you are not at home, the parcel will be stored at the post office, where you can pick it up. Until further notice, <strong>the storage period</strong> for consignments at the branch has been <strong>extended to 30 days</strong> for letters and <strong>15 days </strong>for<strong> </strong>packages.</p>\n<p>For greater security you can use the service of<strong> contactless delivery.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you are in quarantine or isolation</strong> and need to pick up the parcel, <strong>inform the post office.</strong> Then special rules for delivery to quarantined or isolated persons apply.</p>\n<p>If you have a package stored at the post office that can be picked up with an identification code, <strong>the package will be issued to someone who provides the correct identification code</strong> together with the name and surname of the addressee or the delivery number of the parcel. This cannot be used for parcels delivered in person.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/post-office"},"changed":"2020-12-29T22:10:18+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T22:51:27+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.ceskaposta.cz/bezpecnedoruceni?utm_source=web_corona_info&utm_medium=mini_banner&utm_campaign=doruceni_kod","title":"Bezkontakntí doručení na kód "},{"uri":"https://www.ceskaposta.cz/-/ceska-posta-v-pripade-plosne-karanteny-zavede-bezkontaktni-dorucovani","title":"Zvláštní pravidla pro doručování"},{"uri":"https://www.ceskaposta.cz/-/ceska-posta-v-pripade-plosne-karanteny-zavede-bezkontaktni-dorucovani","title":"Aktuální informace"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"local_post_office"},"situation_type":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Hygienic measures in the workplace","path":{"alias":"/situations/employment/hygienic-measures-workplace","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Indoor","path":{"alias":"/situations/face-masks/indoor","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Operation of Public offices","path":{"alias":"/situations/offices-and-institutions/operation-public-offices","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Delivery and courier services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/delivery-and-courier-services","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-12-08T00:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"},"situation":[{"id":"29bf3a0d-146c-59ea-8ff1-14e061c786af","title":"Retail","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail"}},{"id":"364ce4d7-7f46-5870-933d-7481ad1a5903","title":"Post Office","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/post-office"}},{"id":"93bd360a-12b7-5bfc-bf4d-1fe6a9d8c55e","title":"Shopping","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping"}},{"id":"005ea0c7-f646-5875-9ae1-6ed83c1348f4","title":"Services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/services"}},{"id":"16ca4b85-f3dc-5394-9498-4492601ef573","title":"Banks and insurance","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance"}},{"id":"5124cb25-494a-5acc-8bb8-f294cdacb405","title":"Health resorts","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/health-resorts"}},{"id":"4b52758c-592a-52e0-adc9-f33ab3b2fa65","title":" Shopping malls","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/shopping-malls"}},{"id":"7b0b36ea-2872-5c56-91ce-49b05adc1f04","title":"Wholesale","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/wholesale"}},{"id":"25e0fe42-415a-51e7-a1f6-bb97e941560d","title":"Repair shops and after-sale services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/repair-shops-and-after-sale-services"}},{"id":"e5f17c29-fcab-5239-bce1-8d73b8409188","title":"Delivery and courier services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/delivery-and-courier-services"}},{"id":"8e00af9e-fe1f-5a8b-81da-ebb4eac90ea8","title":"Driver's education","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/drivers-education"}},{"id":"a00d85fe-42c6-5545-af85-560415c65382","title":"E-shop","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/e-shop"}},{"id":"6eef451a-c1e7-5e7c-b58a-19b2aa8bb8b3","title":"Markets, farmers markets","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/markets-farmers-markets"}},{"id":"a547b76c-f1e0-5ef5-9bea-b2c2c1d285d4","title":"Theatre, film and other artistic performances","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/theatre-film-and-other-artistic-performances"}},{"id":"4d5d7114-ee63-5763-ba5b-397ac188c89a","title":"Accommodations","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/accommodations"}},{"id":"ba3a6dc8-ca5f-565c-82ad-ac0f233c36ed","title":"Photographers","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/photographers"}},{"id":"8044afbe-d49d-5af1-8a1e-985c64bd24bd","title":"Funeral services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/funeral-services"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/shops-and-services/post-office","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/shops-and-services","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/obchod-sluzby/posta"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

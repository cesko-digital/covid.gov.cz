Before entering the shop, disinfect your hands, and repeat after returning home. For greater protection, it is recommended to wear gloves. Do not touch any surface unnecessarily and use gloves when picking fruits, vegetables or pastries. We recommend that you pay cashless. </p>\n<p>Shops and shopping centres can only be entered<strong> in groups of 2. The reservation of 15 square meters for one customer</strong> is mandatory for any shop or service facility. Customers must also <strong>keep a distance of 2 meters from each other</strong>. For example, in a 29-square-meter facility, only one customer can be present at a time. <strong>Queue management</strong> is also mandatory for shops and services. This Regulation shall apply both to the internal area and to the area outside the establishment.</p>\n<p>In establishments <strong>smaller than 15m²</strong>, this restriction will not apply to persons under the age of 15 and holders of a disability card. In the case of establishments <strong>larger than 15 m²</strong>, this rule will not apply to children under the age of 6 accompanying another customer.</p>\n<p>Holders of a disability card will have a <strong>priority right to enter establishments</strong> so that they do not have to wait in queues. <strong>People with a stroller do not need to have a shopping cart,</strong> and <strong>the child in the stroller will not count towards the number of people allowed in the sales area.</strong> Sales area means the area accessible to customers, including the one under the placed stands, test booths, counters and the area behind the counters, which is used by the sellers.

If this isn't possible, you can reach out to volunteers, who will be happy to assist you. You can also order online and get your shopping delivered to your doorstep.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/retail"},"changed":"2021-02-14T12:01:41+00:00","valid_from":"2020-11-18T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-05T23:00:11+00:00","links":[{"uri":"https://www.businessinfo.cz/clanky/odpovedi-na-nejcastejsi-dotazy-podnikatelu-ohledne-aktualnich-opatreni-proti-sireni-koronaviru/#metodika-oc","title":"Jak zjistit prodejní plochu obchodů?"},{"uri":"https://www.coi.cz/prava-spotrebitelu-v-dobe-nouzoveho-stavu/","title":"Práva spotřebitele"},{"uri":"https://www.coi.cz/reklamace-ve-stavu-nouze/","title":"Reklamace ve stavu nouze"}],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"add_shopping_cart"},"situation_type":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"storefront"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Support and delivery services to risk groups and those infected","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering/support-and-delivery-services-risk-groups-and-those-infected","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hygienic measures in the workplace","path":{"alias":"/situations/employment/hygienic-measures-workplace","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Hand washing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hygiene/hand-washing","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Measures on free movement","path":{"alias":"/situations/free-movement-people/measures-free-movement","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[{"question":"When are shops open?","value":"From 5:00 to 20:59 (this only applies to the shops on the list of exceptions).

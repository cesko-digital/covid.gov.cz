While shopping, <strong>wear your mask</strong> and <strong>social distance</strong> (especially when waiting in a queue). Before entering the shop <strong>disinfect your hands</strong> and repeat after returning home. For more protection, shopping in gloves can be recommended. Don't touch any surfaces unnecessarily and use gloves when picking out fruit, vegetables, or baked goods.</p>\n<p>If you are part of a <strong>higher risk group or are in quarantine</strong> (isolation), ask a neighbor, relative, or friend to do your shopping. If this isn't possible, you can reach out to volunteers, who will be happy to help. <strong>You can also order online and get your shopping delivered to your doorstep. </strong></p>\n<p>Shops and shopping centres can only be entered in <strong>groups of 2</strong>. The exemption being children under 15 accompanied by an adult from the same household (typically parents, grandparents, or siblings living with the child).</p>\n<p>Try to shop online.

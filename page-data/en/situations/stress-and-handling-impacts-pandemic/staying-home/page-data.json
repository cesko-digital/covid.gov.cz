If possible, keep your social contacts through the online platforms during this time. Try to keep your habits and routines as constant as possible. <strong>It is important to eat balanced meals, have enough sleep and rest, and also aim for physical and mental activity.</strong> It is a good idea to keep using stress management methods that have worked for you before and have proven to be effective. There are many ways to reduce stress, such as <strong>relaxation</strong> or <strong>meditation</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can learn about the fundamental recommendations for maintaining mental health in section Stress and handling the impacts of the pandemic &gt; Mental hygiene.</p>\n<p>If you feel that you need to talk to someone, either about a specific problem or just to be in contact with someone, reach to one of the crisis lines. You can find a list of them in section Stress and handling the impacts of the pandemic &gt; Psychological help.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations for coping with cohabitation in the state of emergency</strong></p>\n<p>Spending quarantine in a couple or with family can be an advantage as well as a disadvantage. You and your partner and family can support each other, but there is also a risk that in some time, you will \"start getting on each other's nerves.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What to do to avoid conflicts?</strong></p>\n<ol><li>It is essential to arm yourself with a dose of patience and tolerance - with a pandemic, the dynamics of your coexistence are likely to change, and it takes everyone some time to come to terms with the situation.</li>\n<li>Try to divide the time into the time spent on joint activities and the time for yourself.</li>\n<li>If there are children in your household, try to divide the care equivalently.</li>\n<li>These times can also be exhausting in terms of your worries. You can have concerns about the health of loved ones or the future. Try to open to your partner and talk about your anxieties.</li>\n<li>Do not stifle your feelings inside of you and try to talk about them with your partner and children. If you resolve disputes straight away, there is far less risk that the situation would escalate.</li>\n<li>Remember that the situation also affects children. They cannot see their friends, and they do not have that many options where to drain their energy. If you suddenly find the space in your apartment smaller than usual, try to go for a walk on the fresh air. A short walk will surely help you.</li>\n<li>Have some fun - watch a movie, cook with your family or play a board game.</li>\n</ol><p>\n </p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/staying-home"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-07T13:34:10+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[],"icon":null,"situation_type":{"name":"Stress and handling the impacts of the pandemic","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"psychology"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Helplines","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/helplines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Help for a close one","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/help-close-one","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Quarantine","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/quarantine","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Isolation","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/isolation","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-07T14:34:10+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Stress and handling the impacts of the pandemic","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"psychology"},"situation":[{"id":"4c056a6a-d4d3-5dd7-b849-83429dfd5c30","title":"Mental health durning pandemic","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/mental-health-durning-pandemic"}},{"id":"268b44cc-77e0-5c2e-ad47-b1ad49eba82d","title":"Help for a close one","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/help-close-one"}},{"id":"732505eb-d0ca-59ee-a7f2-130fb21286bb","title":"Helplines","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/helplines"}},{"id":"ecdfaacd-c3a5-5822-afff-4da1fbc28911","title":"Mental hygiene","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/mental-hygiene"}},{"id":"5b4e5f01-5482-58e5-aca3-c64cb234ac61","title":"Staying at home","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/staying-home"}},{"id":"66eb7003-2d5f-55ae-9aaa-733af6bf648e","title":"Alcohol and substance use","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/alcohol-and-substance-use"}},{"id":"4d2ad4fe-5ed0-50c3-ae34-8d4ff029b4a4","title":"Mental hygiene of frontline workers","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/mental-hygiene-frontline-workers"}},{"id":"33d4e37e-1baa-5ffb-8a73-82fdffdc828f","title":"Grief and loss","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/grief-and-loss"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/staying-home","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/stres-zvladani-dopadu-pandemie/doma-behem-nouzoveho-stavu"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

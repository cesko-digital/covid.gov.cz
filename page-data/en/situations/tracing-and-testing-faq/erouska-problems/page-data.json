It may be an eRouška app error. Unfortunately, this cannot be completely prevented, as with any other location-based application. Your error might not be a single event, we recomend having a look at the social networks of eRouška. Possibly the team already knows about the error and are working on it. If that doesn't help, contact the eRouška team at info@erouska.cz.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"relationships":{"related_situations":[{"title":"eRouška / eFaceMask","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/erouska-efacemask","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"How does tracing work?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/how-does-tracing-work","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"SMS with a fake positive result","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/sms-fake-positive-result","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Testing","path":{"alias":"/situations/hoaxes/testing","langcode":"en"}}],"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Tracing and testing - FAQ","path":{"alias":"/situations/tracing-and-testing-faq"}},"measures":[]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/tracing-and-testing-faq/erouska-problems"},"changed":"2020-11-05T19:07:25+00:00","valid_from":null,"links":[],"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/tracing-and-testing-faq/erouska-problems"}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1446925061","2446164016","3493237958","3751664530"]}

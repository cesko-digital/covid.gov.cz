In this case the PCR test has to be carried out between 5 and 7 days after entering the Czech Republic and its result be reported to your regional public health office.</p>\n<p>Should the test have turned a positive result, you are obligated to quarantine yourself again - now you have to manage the tracing of your contact persons, inform your boss, GP, etc. Should you feel yourself sick, please seek advice from your GP. For details on how this is processed, please see the <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/en/situations/infection-and-general-measures/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Infection and general measures section.</a></p>\n<p><strong>FOR TRAFFIC COMPANIES</strong></p>\n<p>All traffic companies are obligated not to allow passengers who have to fill out the <a href=\"https://plf.uzis.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Public Health Passenger Locator Form</a> to board unless these present a document proving they had done so and a certificate issued by an accredited lab proving a negative PCR test result, provided the PCR test had been carried out on the UK territory not longer than 72 hours before boarding.</p>\n<p><strong>THE PURPOSE OF THESE MEASURES</strong></p>\n<p>These measures aim to increase safety of the citizens. They are extraordinary, caused by an outbreak of a novel, highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 mutation in the UK. In order to stop its spread and to protect people within the Czech Republic, it is necessary to react rapidly. Genetical analyses show that the new SARS-CoV-2 strain is defined by several spike proteine mutations (69-70 and 144-145 deletions, N501Y, A5700, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H). The analyses conducted so far show that this strain causes a significantly increased spread when compared to all other known SARS-CoV-2 strains. According to estimations, it could be able to increase the reproduction number by 0.4 or more and the contagiousness by up to 70 per cent (see the <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/threat-assessment-brief-rapid-increase-sars-cov-2-variant-united-kingdom\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">ECDC Threat Assessment Brief from December 20, 2020</a>).</p>\n<p>During your quarantine, please behave extremely considerate. You are allowed to leave the premises where you are isolated, but only in order to manage your everyday essentials (buying groceries, caring for your children &amp; pets, using financial &amp; postal services etc.) However, while doing so, please avoid „peak times“ (i.e. time slots when stores, offices etc. are full of people) and adhere strictly to the „3Z rule“.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/traveling-tofrom-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-december-20-2020"},"changed":"2021-01-05T15:59:03+00:00","valid_from":"2021-01-05T00:00:00+01:00","langcode":"en","created":"2020-12-21T23:59:41+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"airplanemode_active"},"situation_type":{"name":"Travelling abroad","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"explore"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[{"title":"Airports","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/airports","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"The traveler’s map (conditions of entry into the country / obligations upon return to the Czech Republic)","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/travelers-map-conditions-entry-country-obligations-upon-return-czech","langcode":"en"}}]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2021-01-05T17:00:00+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Travelling abroad","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"explore"},"situation":[{"id":"2573a05d-9bd6-578f-a7b0-67cbae93b948","title":"The traveler’s map (conditions of entry into the country / obligations upon return to the Czech Republic)","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/travelers-map-conditions-entry-country-obligations-upon-return-czech"}},{"id":"9a24c578-c51f-55af-83b1-553684c0870f","title":"Business trips abroad","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/business-trips-abroad"}},{"id":"9c1a4673-6d57-523a-bb95-5e1e66c845a7","title":"Airports","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/airports"}},{"id":"41b90478-205e-5f71-b823-e92aa6caf89c","title":"Slovakia","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/slovakia"}},{"id":"a0fdf5be-ad23-564c-919a-b59770fa4196","title":"Cross-border workers","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/cross-border-workers"}},{"id":"b92dacdb-7031-5207-aec4-2ea76dffd94d","title":"Visas","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/visas"}},{"id":"992cca62-8afd-5beb-b711-106ccb4ca771","title":"Family or partner abroad","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/family-or-partner-abroad"}},{"id":"ac2c4877-31e6-5271-b96b-902e2df23fcc","title":"Crossing the green border","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/crossing-green-border"}},{"id":"4a27da05-7ed4-5778-a82a-65ef345ec865","title":"Students abroad","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/students-abroad"}},{"id":"89010fb9-072e-59ba-9c9e-8cf353fa7475","title":"Traveling to/from Great Britain and Northern Ireland from December 20, 2020 onwards","path":{"alias":"/situations/travelling-abroad/traveling-tofrom-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-december-20-2020"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/travelling-abroad/traveling-tofrom-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-december-20-2020","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/travelling-abroad","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/zahranici/cestovani-doz-velke-britanie-severniho-irska-od-20-12-2020"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

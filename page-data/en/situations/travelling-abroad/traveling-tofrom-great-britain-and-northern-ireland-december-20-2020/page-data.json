In order to stop its spread and protect people living here, a rapid reaction is necessary.</p>\n<p>During your isolation, please behave considerately. Provided you need to do your everyday essentials (buying groceries, caring your children or pets, using financial &amp; postal services etc.), you are allowed to leave your home. Please, however, avoid peak times at stores, offices etc. and adhere strictly to the \"3Z rule\".</p>\n<p>Starting at 12:00pm December 21, 2020, <strong>no direct flights between the Great Britain/the Northern Ireland and the Czech Republic are allowed anymore</strong>.

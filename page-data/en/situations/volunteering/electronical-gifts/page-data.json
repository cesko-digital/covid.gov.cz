One of them may be the lack of an opportunity for households to prepare for an online lifestyle.</p>\n<p>These are mainly children from socially disadvantaged or multiple-membered families who cannot attend distance learning, for example, due to a lack of internet connection, not owning a computer or tablet from which to connect. Therefore, if someone has a computer, laptop, or tablet that they do not need, provide it to a family or school facility where they will find a great use for it.</p>\n<p>If you do not know any family in need in your area, contact the nearest schools. They will advise you on how to proceed. Several initiatives address this issue.

Anyone who wants to voluntarily devote part of their time, energy or abilities to the benefit of others will greatly help our health and social system. There are some ways on how to contribute.</p>\n<p>First of all, it is necessary to mention the Act on Voluntary Service (Act No. 198/2002 Coll.), it is under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior and defines the legal framework of the volunteer programs in the Czech Republic. This law governs those organisations that have been granted accreditation by the Ministry of the Interior in the field of volunteer services. The law stipulates, among other things, the definition, scope and forms of volunteer service, defines the rights and obligations of organisations that prepare volunteers for their activities (sending organisations) and organisations in which volunteers perform their activities (receiving organisations). It also regulates what is considered to be a volunteer activity, the conditions that the volunteer must meet, etc. All information can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.mzcr.cz/category/programy-a-strategie/dobrovolnik-ve-zdravotnictvi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">website</a> of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>During the current situation, volunteers are needed especially in the health sector. Most hospitals affected by the covid-19 pandemic suffer from staff shortages. If you are interested in helping, contact the nearest hospital. Another option is to fill in the form on the <a href=\"https://covid-nemocnice.uzis.cz/form\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">website</a> of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, where after sending the form you will be contacted by the institution itself. The Czech Red Cross also takes care of the sick, and organises a course on modern nursing in practice. All information can be found on the <a href=\"https://zvladnemeto.cervenykriz.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">website</a> of the Czech Red Cross.</p>\n<p>Volunteers are also needed in social services. You can read more about volunteering in social services on the website of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. You can find a list of all accredited social facilities in the register of social service providers. If you would like to help, look up the provider's registry and do not hesitate to contact them.</p>\n"},"path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering/volunteering-hospitals-and-social-services"},"changed":"2020-12-05T20:31:53+00:00","valid_from":null,"langcode":"en","created":"2020-11-21T18:00:00+00:00","links":[],"relationships":{"region":[{"name":"All regions of Czechia"}],"icon":{"code":"support"},"situation_type":{"name":"Volunteering","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"support"}}},"measures":[],"related_situations":[]},"questions_answers":[],"update":null,"valid_to":null,"last_updated":"2020-11-21T15:35:33+01:00"},"situationArea":{"name":"Volunteering","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering"},"relationships":{"icon":{"code":"support"},"situation":[{"id":"ad91f56f-b5ce-5720-a000-7682cbcb9dba","title":"Blood donators","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering/blood-donators"}},{"id":"41928be8-798e-5bde-8b42-87c7fd0ea79e","title":"Financial gifts","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering/financial-gifts"}},{"id":"12e8b92d-c18b-5b9b-b418-1fe1abc178a7","title":"Electronical gifts","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering/electronical-gifts"}},{"id":"238d0249-e17e-5086-b6bf-3a7baa454fec","title":"Support and delivery services to risk groups and those infected","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering/support-and-delivery-services-risk-groups-and-those-infected"}},{"id":"844dc3ff-e277-5707-bccb-3e5d1fcf8c6c","title":"Volunteering in hospitals and social services","path":{"alias":"/situations/volunteering/volunteering-hospitals-and-social-services"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/volunteering/volunteering-hospitals-and-social-services","langCode":"en","listSlug":"/situations/volunteering","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/dobrovolnictvi/dobrovolnictvi-v-nemocnicich-socialnich-sluzbach"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1119304123","1211267612","1211267612","2446164016","4279535114"]}

AÂ pandemic is aÂ completely unknown situation. Such unpleasant feelings, caused in particular by great uncertainty, are completely normal and natural.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain relationships and social contact as you did.</strong> People naturally live in relationships - partner, family, friends. Therefore, it is not surprising that quarantine and social isolation do not benefit us. But it is these measures that are most effective in combating the pandemic. If you do not live alone, try to make the most of this time to take care of your relationships. Watch aÂ movie together or play aÂ board game. To communicate with others, use all methods of long-distance communication - mobile phone, video calls, social networks, etc. If you feel lonely, it is possible that you do not even want to be in contact, because loneliness feeds on itself. In that case, acknowledge but don'tÂ intentionally support this feeling and contact someone close to you, it will definitely help you.</li>\n<li><strong>Hold the mode and live as \"normal\" as possible.Â </strong>Even if you work from home, try to maintain aÂ regime similar to how you would go to work. Try to observe regular wake up time and working hours. When the days dissolve into aÂ kind of \"vacuum,\" anxiety or remorse are far more likely to occur.

For this purpose, use only the ties, or elastic bands attached to the face mask, and carefully adjust around the nose area if necessary. There should be no gaps between the face and the face mask after putting the mask on correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Wearing aÂ face mask</strong><br />\n\tIt is necessary to change your face mask whenever it gets wet (because aÂ damp mask is not effectively protecting you or the others anymore). It all depends on the material the face mask is made of; however, we recommend changing your mask about every 2Â hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Taking aÂ face mask off</strong><br />\n\tPlease do not touch the front part of the mask when removing it because it may contain droplets with virus and bacteria. For this purpose, use only the ties, or elastic bands attached to the face mask.<br />\n\tPlease dispose any used disposable face masks immediately (ideally into the bin placed in front of your house, however, there is no special container for this purpose). Please wash and disinfect your hands afterwards.<br />\n\tPlease boil your fabric face masks after taking off your face and wash afterwards (you can do this with aÂ hand soap). If you are unable to do this immediately, please place your face mask into aÂ sealable plastic bag and disinfect your face mask when possible. You can find how to do this below.</li>\n</ol><p>Please do not use <strong>disposable </strong>protective aids repeatedly. They lose their filtering effect when getting damp. It is possible to remove virus and bacteria by disinfecting, however, it is impossible to renew the filtering effect. By disinfecting the filtering effect can be also decreased. <strong>It is possible to use fabric face masks repeatedly, however, it is vital to disinfect them regularly.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to disinfect your face mask?</h2>\n<p>It is possible to <strong>wash your face mask in aÂ washing machine</strong>. To increase the effectiveness of the face covering we recommend to:</p>\n<ol><li>Wash your face masks separately from your other clothes.</li>\n<li>Wash your face masks with aÂ standardly used laundry detergent, you can also add aÂ special laundry disinfectant or bleaching products.</li>\n<li>Use aÂ boil wash washing machine settings. The virus will be killed after washing at aÂ minimum temperature of 60Â°CÂ and the minimum amount of time of 30 minutes.</li>\n<li>Dry your face masks after washing them (you can also use aÂ tumble dryer), and iron your face mask with aÂ steam ironer. Please use as high temperature settings as possible.</li>\n<li>Always handle your face masks with clean hands, cleaned with hand soap, or disinfected.</li>\n<li>Keep your clean face masks separately (e.g.Â in an airtight container).</li>\n</ol><p>Or you can also <strong>boil wash </strong>your face masks. How to do this?</p>\n<ol><li>Place your face masks in aÂ pot of water, put them completely in the water, and boil for at least 5Â minutes.</li>\n<li>Leave the face masks to cool down in the water.</li>\n<li>Take your face masks out of the water and leave them to air dry. Iron your face mask with aÂ steam ironer.

Therefore, please wash or boil your face masks first.</li>\n<li><strong>Using aÂ freezer. </strong>COVID-19 is pretty resistant to low temperatures. For that reason, it will not kill the virus. You will also risk contamination of the food placed in your freezer.</li>\n<li><strong>Using an oven or aÂ microwave.</strong> By placing your face masks into the oven or microwave, there is aÂ risk of fire.

Its purpose is to convince the reader that there is in fact no pandemic and that everything is just aÂ \"clever\" form of deception to gain control of humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>AÂ pandemic is aÂ mass occurrence of an infectious disease across many different regions. The WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 aÂ pandemic on 11.3Â 2020. Up until 3.11. almost 47 million people had been infected worldwide and 1.21 million people had passed away as aÂ result of the infection.

In no case is its spread possible by radio waves. Likewise, there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate any effect of electronic signals on the human immune system or DNA structure.</p>\n<p><strong>The WHO has stated that Covid is not dangerous</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hoax:</strong></p>\n<p>This hoax gained traction after an interview in the discussion program Prima Partie, where Lenka ZlÃ¡malovÃ¡ said: âThe World Health Organization (WHO) has currently published aÂ completely new study, which we could call aÂ meta-analysis that brings together data from about seventy studies from around the world, which show that the danger of the virus and the mortality of the virus are both many times lower than previously stated. The original figures were 3.4%, while the latest ones mentioned were between 1% and 0.4%. Now the WHO, which still has some authority, says it'sÂ 0.23%. To give viewers an idea, this is at the level not of the flu, but common viruses. So IÂ wonder how the government and the new the health minister will react to this.

Anyone who wants to voluntarily devote part of their time, energy or abilities to the benefit of others will greatly help our health and social system. There are some ways on how to contribute.</p>\n<p>First of all, it is necessary to mention the Act on Voluntary Service (Act No. 198/2002 Coll.), it is under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior andÂ defines the legal framework of theÂ volunteer programs in the Czech Republic. This law governs those organisations that have been granted accreditation by the Ministry of the Interior in the field of volunteer services. The law stipulates, among other things, the definition, scope and forms of volunteer service, defines the rights and obligations of organisations that prepare volunteers for their activities (sending organisations) and organisations in which volunteers perform their activities (receiving organisations). It also regulates what is considered to be aÂ volunteer activity, the conditions that the volunteer must meet, etc. All information can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.mzcr.cz/category/programy-a-strategie/dobrovolnik-ve-zdravotnictvi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">website</a> of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>During the current situation, volunteers are needed especially in the health sector. Most hospitals affected by the covid-19 pandemic suffer from staff shortages. If you are interested in helping, contact the nearest hospital. Another option is to fill in the form on the <a href=\"https://covid-nemocnice.uzis.cz/form\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">website</a> of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, where after sending the form you will be contacted by the institution itself. The Czech Red Cross also takes care of the sick, andÂ organises aÂ course on modern nursing in practice. All information can be found on the <a href=\"https://zvladnemeto.cervenykriz.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">website</a> of the Czech Red Cross.</p>\n<p>Volunteers are also needed in social services. You can read more about volunteering in social services on the website of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. You can find aÂ list of all accredited social facilities in the register of social service providers. If you would like to help, look up the provider'sÂ registry and do not hesitate to contact them.</p>\n","path":"/situations/volunteering/volunteering-hospitals-and-social-services","langcode":"en"},"a2":{"title":"KompenzaÄnÃ­ bonus aÂ oÅ¡etÅovnÃ© pro OSVÄ aÂ invalidnÃ­ dÅ¯chod","content":"<h2>KompenzaÄnÃ­ bonusÂ </h2>\n<ul><li>\n<p>podmÃ­nkou ÄerpÃ¡nÃ­Â kompenzaÄnÃ­ho bonusu je pouze pÅevaÅ¾ujÃ­cÃ­ Äinnost podnikÃ¡nÃ­ vÂ oboru, kterÃ½ byl pÅÃ­mo uzavÅen vÂ dÅ¯sledku vlÃ¡dnÃ­ch restrikcÃ­. <strong>Osoby pobÃ­rajÃ­cÃ­ invalidnÃ­ dÅ¯chod</strong> tedy mohou po splnÄnÃ­ podmÃ­nek oÂ kompenzaÄnÃ­ bonus Å¾Ã¡dat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/kompenzace/kompenzacni-bonus-pro-osvc-dpp-dpc-male-sro\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">PodrobnÃ© informace ke kompenzaÄnÃ­mu bonusu</a></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Program ''OÅ¡etÅovnÃ©Â pro OSVÄ''</strong></h2>\n<ul><li>osoby samostatnÄ vÃ½dÄleÄnÄ ÄinnÃ©Â <strong>pobÃ­rajÃ­cÃ­ invalidnÃ­ dÅ¯chod</strong> <strong>neboÂ starajÃ­cÃ­ se oÂ nezaopatÅenÃ© dÃ­tÄ maximÃ¡lnÄ do vÄku 26 le</strong>t, kterÃ© je <strong>zÃ¡vislÃ© na pomoci jinÃ© osoby alespoÅ ve stupni I</strong> podle zÃ¡kona Ä.Â 108/2006 Sb., oÂ sociÃ¡lnÃ­ch sluÅ¾bÃ¡ch,Â se mÅ¯Å¾e sama rozhodnout, zda bude podnikat na hlavnÃ­ nebo vedlejÅ¡Ã­ Äinnost.Â <strong>PokudÂ </strong><strong>vykonÃ¡vala samostatnou vÃ½dÄleÄnou Äinnost na hlavnÃ­ Äinnost pÅi podÃ¡nÃ­ Å¾Ã¡dosti aÂ po celou dobu, na kterou dotaci ÄerpÃ¡</strong>, tak dleÂ  bodu 3Â Programu podpory malÃ½ch podnikÅ¯ postiÅ¾enÃ½ch celosvÄtovÃ½m Å¡Ã­ÅenÃ­m onemocnÄnÃ­ COVID-19 zpÅ¯sobenÃ©ho virem SARS-CoV-19 âOÅ ETÅOVNÃâ PRO OSVÄÂ <strong>mÅ¯Å¾e bÃ½t pÅÃ­jemcem podpory</strong>.Â  Zda je invalidnÃ­ osoba osobou samostatnÄ vÃ½dÄleÄnÄ Äinnou na hlavnÃ­ Äinnost je tÅeba pro potÅeby ÅÃ­zenÃ­ oÂ dotaci doloÅ¾it potvrzenÃ­mÂ mÃ­stnÄ pÅÃ­sluÅ¡nÃ© okresnÃ­ sprÃ¡vÄÂ sociÃ¡lnÃ­ho zabezpeÄenÃ­, pÅÃ­padnÄ je toto potvrzenÃ­ vyÅ¾Ã¡dÃ¡no ze strany Ministerstva prÅ¯myslu aÂ obchodu ÄR.</li>\n</ul><p>DalÅ¡Ã­ dotaÄnÃ­ programy - <strong>COVID NÃ¡jemnÃ© </strong>aÂ <strong>COVID Kultura</strong> mohou tÃ©Å¾ Äerpat osoby pobÃ­rajÃ­cÃ­ invalidnÃ­ dÅ¯chod.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Â </h2>\n","path":"/situace/osoby-se-zdravotnim-postizenim/kompenzacni-bonus-osetrovne-pro-osvc-invalidni-duchod","langcode":"cs"},"a3":{"title":"PÅipravuje se: VylitÃ© pivo trvale osvobozeno od danÄ","content":"<p>(ProbÃ­hÃ¡ legislativnÃ­m procesem.)</p>\n<p><strong>Pivovary</strong> zÅejmÄ budou iÂ do budoucna <strong>osvobozeny od spotÅebnÃ­ danÄ za vylitÃ© nebo jim vrÃ¡cenÃ© pivo</strong>.

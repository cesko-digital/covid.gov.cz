A pandemic is a completely unknown situation. Such unpleasant feelings, caused in particular by great uncertainty, are completely normal and natural.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain relationships and social contact as you did.</strong> People naturally live in relationships - partner, family, friends. Therefore, it is not surprising that quarantine and social isolation do not benefit us. But it is these measures that are most effective in combating the pandemic. If you do not live alone, try to make the most of this time to take care of your relationships. Watch a movie together or play a board game. To communicate with others, use all methods of long-distance communication - mobile phone, video calls, social networks, etc. If you feel lonely, it is possible that you do not even want to be in contact, because loneliness feeds on itself. In that case, acknowledge but don't intentionally support this feeling and contact someone close to you, it will definitely help you.</li>\n<li><strong>Hold the mode and live as \"normal\" as possible. </strong>Even if you work from home, try to maintain a regime similar to how you would go to work. Try to observe regular wake up time and working hours. When the days dissolve into a kind of \"vacuum,\" anxiety or remorse are far more likely to occur. In addition, a regular daily schedule gives us a sense of security in an otherwise uncertain time. </li>\n<li><strong>Don't focus all your attention on coronavirus only. </strong>While it is important to seek information about the current situation, it is also important to be able to turn off the media at some point. Overwhelming information can then cause feelings of anxiety. Set a time for you to read the news, e.g. 30 minutes in the morning and evening.</li>\n<li><strong>Sport benefits mental health. </strong>Exercise plays a key role in our mental well-being. Try to go for a walk every day for a while or at least work out at home, for example, according to one of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG5CBmocpXM&amp;list=PLuhJ8-1PdCjx6I8bzA0ZfFJOHkcU0E2wG&amp;index=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">videos of the Czech Army</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help.</strong> If you feel that the situation is affecting you and you need to confide in someone, solve a specific problem or just talk to someone, do not hesitate to contact one of the helplines.</li>\n</ol><p>The article is an abbreviated version of the text Six Steps to Mental Health by Nela G. Wurmová, you can<a href=\"https://psychologie.cz/sest-kroku-dusevnimu-zdravi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\"> read the whole text</a>.</p>\n<h2>\n </h2>\n","path":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/mental-hygiene","langcode":"en"},"3i":{"title":"Secondary schools","content":"<h2>Rules and recommendations</h2>\n<p>Based on governmental measures, in-person education in secondary schools is banned.

The first step should be to contact your creditor as soon as possible. Do not wait for anything and contact your bank or non-banking company by phone or via the Internet. Currently, banks provide individual solutions for your specific case. Most banks have clear instructions on their websites to help explain your problem. If the bank refuse, you always have the option of having your application checked by the bank's ombudsman, who will find out whether the bank has complied with the regulations.</p>\n<p>Clients of non-banking companies have a right to contact Czech Leasing and Financial Association or Association of Non-banking Credit Providers. If your financial difficulties persist, contact the Financial Distress Counseling Center or the Financial Arbiter.</p>\n","path":"/situations/business-activities/impossibility-repay-loan-or-mortgage-business","langcode":"en"},"7t":{"title":"Working with a client","content":"<h2>Rules and recommendations</h2>\n<p>The provision of services in establishments is currently prohibited.

These so-called \"rapid antigen tests\" reveal patients at the peak of the infection, when the body has the highest concentration of these proteins. It is as such that the highest risk of transmitting the infection to other people. Compared to RT-PCR tests, the <strong>advantage is lower demands on the expertise</strong> of medical staff in sampling, the possibility of <strong>evaluating the test directly on the site</strong> and the speed of this evaluation (time from sampling to the result does not exceed 30 minutes) and it is 10 times cheaper. On the contrary, the disadvantage is that they are not as sensitive as the standard RT-PCR tests used to accurately identify those infected according to the algorithm of the Ministry of Health.</p>\n<h2><strong>Test process</strong></h2>\n<p>They identify you upon arrival, have an OP or CP with you. You will receive an e-Request, it will take up to 3-5 minutes for the healthcare professional to handle this administration. Collection will take approx. 1-2 min. for the test taker, the collection itself is the same as for PCR tests, i.e. swab the nasal cavity with a special stick. Execution, evaluation and registration of the test result takes 15 - 35 minutes. In total, the <strong>test taker waits on the spot for the test result within an hour.</strong></p>\n<p>The Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic has also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aEHOflXB2k&amp;feature=emb_logo\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">prepared a short instructional video</a>, so <strong>you can see what will happen</strong>. </p>\n<p>There is also an instructional <strong>video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhX-AwbV2NQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">general practitioners and specialists</a> who would like to participate at the Covid-19 testing points.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Test safety and reliability</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Tests are not dangerous</strong> if they are performed only by trained health professionals. Therefore, each sampling point must be registered and healthcare professionals trained. We understand that nasopharyngeal swab is not a pleasant thing. Therefore, follow the doctor's instructions to ensure that the collection is successful and at the same time it will be at least uncomfortable for you.</p>\n<p>Calculations of the so-called <strong>specificity and sensitivity</strong> are used to determine the reliability and error rate of antigen tests.</p>\n<p>Sensitivity is measured by the ratio of those tested positive by the antigen test to all those infected (including people whose tests are negative, even if the reference RT-PCR test tested positive). According to information from the press conference 26.11. 2020 (State Institute of Public Health - Ostrava), antigenic tests imported into the Czech Republic have a sensitivity ranging from 81% to 98%. <strong>This means that a negative result from antigen testing does not necessarily mean that you are not infected with the same reliability as a PCR test.</strong></p>\n<p>Specificity is measured by the ratio of those tested negative to the antigen test against all uninfected (including people who tested positive for the antigen test, even if the reference RT-PCR test was negative). Antigenic assays generally have a high degree of specificity. <strong>This means that a person who has tested positive for an antigen is most likely to be infected.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Can the testing be declined by a practitioner?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. The testing is not carried out if the person supposed to be tested was isolated due to COVID-19 (at least for a minimal time span as stated in the current version of the Ministry of Health extraordinary measure regarding antigenic testing) <strong>and </strong>his/her first positive RT-PCR test result is less than 90 days ago.

However, they can also issue you an e-Request if you describe your situation- that is, PL was not available to you.</p>\n<h2><strong>I think I suffer from Covid. Should I go for an antigen test or a PCR test? Or can I choose?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus disease or have been in risky contact with a positively tested person, contact your GP and follow his instructions. He will probably either invite you to his office for an antigen test or write you an e-Request for a PCR test.</p>\n<h2><strong>Can I refuse testing?</strong></h2>\n<p>You can refuse comprehensive preventive testing with antigen tests. If you are issued an eRequest by a GP - you have symptoms- you are in risky contact, it is your duty to attend the tests. In this case, it will be a PCR test, not an antigen test.</p>\n<h2><strong>When can I be denied testing?</strong></h2>\n<p>The examination is not performed on persons who have undergone isolation due to COVID-19 at least to the extent of the valid emergency measure of the Ministry of Health regulating the regulation of isolation and quarantine and at the same time no more than 90 days have elapsed since the first RT-PCR test. It is also not performed on individuals who have undergone a negative RT-PCR test in the last 3 days.</p>\n","path":"/situations/antigen-testing-sars-cov-2/problems-and-failures-can-occur-when-testing-ag-tests","langcode":"en"},"bk":{"title":"Veletrhy","content":"<p>Pořádání veletrhů je nadále bez výjimek zakázáno.</p>\n","path":"/situace/obchod-sluzby/veletrhy","langcode":"cs"},"bl":{"title":"COVID  Accommodation II","content":"<p><em>Small accommodation facilities are included in this programme. </em></p>\n<p>Individual accommodation facilities consist of accommodation services and are usually for a specific targeted group, both individual tourists as well as school trips (recreational areas, cottages in the mountains), etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is the support intended for</strong>: Individual accommodation facilities (i.e  private accommodation, small boarding houses, apartments, rooms, recreational facilities used for temporary accommodation), is not intended for accommodation services in an apartment building (e.g. airbnb), because these apartments can be leased by the real estate market.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum amount of support:</strong> A subsidy of CZK 200 room/day.

They are extraordinary, caused by an outbreak of a novel, highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 mutation in the UK. In order to stop its spread and to protect people within the Czech Republic, it is necessary to react rapidly. Genetical analyses show that the new SARS-CoV-2 strain is defined by several spike proteine mutations (69-70 and 144-145 deletions, N501Y, A5700, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H). The analyses conducted so far show that this strain causes a significantly increased spread when compared to all other known SARS-CoV-2 strains. According to estimations, it could be able to increase the reproduction number by 0.4 or more and the contagiousness by up to 70 per cent (see the <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/threat-assessment-brief-rapid-increase-sars-cov-2-variant-united-kingdom\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">ECDC Threat Assessment Brief from December 20, 2020</a>).</p>\n<p>During your quarantine, please behave extremely considerate.

What will happen in my body?","content":"<p><strong>The vaccine against Covid-19 is a drug protecting individual from the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2</strong> by inducing immune system reaction against the virus. In layman’s terms, vaccine learns the body where are the weaknesses of the virus and how to produce adequate immune system reaction so that your immune system could kill the virus before its reproduction in the body.</p>\n<p>The availability of a safe and effective vaccine against Covid-19 is necessary to secure protection against the disease, especially for medical workers, risk groups (e.g., pensioners or chronically ill persons).</p>\n<h2>How the vaccine works and how long lasts the protection?</h2>\n<p>The vaccines learn our immune system how to recognize the causative agent of the viral disease and how to defend the body against him. Covid-19 vaccine developers concentrate their attention on inducing the reaction against the protein (or its part) on the surface of the coronavirus (so-called spike protein or S protein) – this protein is the unique identification of the virus. After the vaccination, the immune system will be able to produce the desired reaction. If a vaccinated person is infected, the immune system will recognize the virus and will be able to protect vaccinated individual against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.</p>\n<p>As we are facing quite a new virus, we do not have sufficient research knowledge about the length of immunity induced by the vaccine and whether regular revaccination is needed. The data from immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness studies will help us in the long term to (re)define future vaccination strategies.</p>\n<h2>Protection against mutations</h2>\n<p>Viruses can mutate (change their genetic material); different viruses mutate differently while mutations need not have an impact on the quality of vaccine protection. Some vaccines against viral diseases retain their ability to protect for many years. Example of vaccines providing long-lasting protection is measles or mumps vaccine. On the other hand, there are diseases (such as influenza) with greater ability to change the virus strains. Thus, there is a need to modify e.g., influenza vaccine to ensure the quality of protection.</p>\n<p>The scientific community and regulatory bodies closely monitor whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates and if the vaccine will provide the protection also against new mutations.</p>\n<h2>Vaccine side effects</h2>\n<p>After the vaccination, there may be <strong>headache, fatigue, or aching limbs.</strong> It is normal to have certain reactions after vaccination, mentioned side effects are not symptoms of the disease. The goal of vaccination is to learn our immune system how to fight the disease. This process however might have above-mentioned inconveniences.</p>\n<p><strong>In rare cases</strong>, severe negative side effects might occur.

You register through the website and you will receive a vaccination date. The system works similarly to the antigen testing system. The Central Reservation System (CRS) works as a registration and reservation for vaccination and fully provides you through the vaccination process. The system is designed to support prioritisation. It is designed so that the registration can be done on behalf of the elderly (by family members, social workers, general practitioners, or it is possible to use the help line 1221). The system is linked to the Infectious Diseases Information System (ISIN).</p>\n<p><strong>How to register and secure a vaccination date?</strong></p>\n<p>The central registration system was launched on 15 January 2021 for all 80+ people.</p>\n<p>1. You must register on the website <a href=\"https://crs.uzis.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">crs.uzis.cz</a>, or <a href=\"https://registrace.mzcr.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">registrace.mzcr.cz</a> - both links are functional and available only in the Czech language. Both links will direct you to the online registration form for citizens, indicating your interest and consent to vaccination. Fill in the attributes for prioritisation (including a group type), i.e. information about yourself.</p>\n<p>2. Prioritisation will take place - a point score is calculated together with the vaccine delivery plan that determines when you will be asked to book a specific date. If capacity allows, you will receive an appointment immediately. However, it may happen that due to the capacity reasons you do not immediately receive the exact date. Instead, you receive an SMS and an email confirming your registration, and as soon as the capacity allows, you will be assigned a date. You can find more info about the prioritisation system in a <a href=\"https://covid.gov.cz/situace/ockovani/jak-funguje-prioritizacni-system\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">life situation on the web</a>. Get acquainted with the procedure and note that there will be no prioritisation within the first few days.</p>\n<p>3. Reservation of dates (for both doses) - based on the PIN2 code sent in the SMS, you are allowed to book both vaccination dates in the central reservation system.</p>\n<p>You may not receive your PIN2 immediately as it depends on the vaccines availability.

It will be necessary to create an effective communication campaign in order for the vaccination to be effective. The principle of the registration presumes the gradual release of reservations in the CRS for priority groups according to the vaccine supply plan. In exceptional circumstances it is possible to supplement the registration, for example, from the non-priority group according to the registrations that will be available. The free spaces will be filled from other registrations (usually people with a lower score/age). The algorithm is created based on the capacity and supply.</p>\n<p><strong>How the Central Reservation System (CRS) works?</strong></p>\n<p>The CRS is not just a standard reservation system for vaccinations. It also provides non-standard booking processes (two dates at different intervals depending on the type of vaccine) and also ensures a second “available” date for vaccination. In addition, it includes a prioritised parameters calculator. It adjusts the prioritisation of parameters based on the state of vaccine supply; citizens' interest in vaccination and occupancy of vaccination sites. The CRS is identical for the whole Czech Republic. The connection to the ISIN is important for example for issuing and verifying certificates of vaccination; including support for mobile devices and compatibility with the EU and WHO standards, or for keeping an electronic vaccination card.</p>\n<p>All types of vaccination sites must use the CRS (except for the GPs once they are involved in vaccination). The CRS processes personal data based on Article 6 (1) (e) and Article 9 (2) (i) of the GDPR as necessary for the fulfilment of the task performed in the public interest entrusted as administrator by the Ministry of Health in the field of public health and the protection against serious health threats. The persons interested in vaccination will be informed about the processing of their data filled in the form. The processing of personal data is carried out by the GDPR Regulation.</p>\n<p>The system must be designed on the principles of central registration and prioritisation, as well as central reservation management due to the nature of the process and the need for capacity management concerning vaccine supplies. Therefore, it is not possible to use the existing reservation systems by the health care providers, because there is no mechanism for passing detailed information about the current priority groups. The form is the starting point for entering the vaccination process. Provides access to vaccination registration from one place (form/web MH). It is required to fill in the form.

Vaccine by Moderna is not granted for children under 18.</p>\n<p><strong>PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIC DISEASES</strong></p>\n<p>During real vaccination by mRNA vaccine – not in clinical studies – anaphylactic reactions have been reported. The risk of anaphylactic reaction after mRNA vaccination is negligible – one in hundred/four hundred thousand doses. The probability is higher in comparison with routine vaccines but still very low. Majority of anaphylactic reactions come within 15 minutes after vaccination and is typical for individuals diagnosed with the previous vaccine-related allergies or injection therapy allergies. These factors are not marked as a contraindication for a vaccination, but you should be careful in this case. mRNA vaccine may be used after informing the individual about the possible risk of severe allergic reaction and take this into account while weighing up risks and benefits of vaccination.  Individuals with an immediate allergic reaction after the first dose of the vaccine should not be vaccinated with the second dose. Symptoms of hypersensitivity – anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress (wheezing or stridor) – appearing within an hour of receiving the vaccine are considered to be an immediate allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>mRNA vaccines are contraindicated for individuals having an immediate allergic reaction after any part of the vaccine. Both mRNA vaccines include only a few allergens, especially – polyethylene glycol and related molecules. Polyethylene glycol is not a part of any other registered vaccine. Reason for contraindication is also an immediate allergic reaction on the related molecule of polysorbate which is used in vaccines as a stabilizer. However, allergy to these substances is very rare. Contact dermatitis, food allergies, pollen allergies or latex allergies are not contraindications to vaccination. Vaccination centres must be equipped to cure possible anaphylactic reactions. Every staff member must be trained to recognize such a reaction and must be able to handle the situation properly. The training of the staff must be documented. Vaccination centre must dispose of at least adrenaline, a tonometer, a stethoscope, and possibly other equipment to handle the situation. Written instructions must be also well prepared for this scenario. All vaccinated people with an immediate allergic reaction on any vaccine substance must be monitored in a medical facility at least 30 minutes after vaccination, standard monitoring period is 15 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>PEOPLE WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, due to lack of research knowledge, we are unable to say much about Covid-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness for individuals with autoimmune diseases despite these individuals has been found eligible to be in the sample for clinical research studies. Individuals with autoimmune diseases who participated in clinical studies and got mRNA vaccine did not statistically differ from the control group (with placebo) in terms of occurrence of symptoms typical for autoimmune diagnosis or inflammatory disorders. Thus, individuals with autoimmune diseases with no other contraindication can be vaccinated.</p>\n<p><strong>PREGNANT WOMEN</strong></p>\n<p>Amongst pregnant women, there is a higher probability of severe Covid-19 disease. There is also a greater risk of premature birth. Pregnancy was considered to be excluding factor from any study of mRNA vaccine. According to available research data, we cannot assess the effectiveness and safety of mRNA vaccines in a cohort of pregnant women. Pregnant women with another health or occupational risk are recommended to individually consider benefits and risks of vaccination (ideally with a specialist).</p>\n<p>Vaccines do not contain live virus parts; mRNA does not interact with the nucleus and is rapidly degraded. Animal studies of developmental and reproductive toxicology have not proved any harmful effect on pregnancy. No safety signals had been detected amongst women who became pregnant during clinical trials.</p>\n<p><strong>BREASTFEEDING WOMEN</strong></p>\n<p>For breastfeeding women, facts and recommendations are similar as for pregnant women. However, the risk of severe Covid-19 disease is not increased for breastfeeding women. Nevertheless, breastfeeding was considered to be excluding factor from any study of mRNA vaccine. Current research data do now allow us to examine the effectiveness and safety of mRNA vaccines for breastfeeding women and her child. Breastfeeding women with another health or occupational risk are recommended to individually consider benefits and risks of vaccination (ideally with a specialist). Though, vaccination is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding.</p>\n<p><strong>PEOPLE WITH COMORBIDITIES</strong></p>\n<p>Some chronic diseases are increasing the risk of severe Covid-19 disease and subsequently the risk of death. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine have been proved in the research studies examining the impact on the cohort of people with comorbidities. The risks are comparable with the cohort of people without comorbidities. The list of chronic diseases includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, lung, liver, and renal diseases, chronic (stabilized and well-controlled) HIV, HCV, and HBV infection. Vaccination is definitely recommended for individuals with chronic diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>PEOPLE WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend vaccination for any individual with immunodeficiency including individuals with oncological disease and individuals on immunosuppressive therapy. These individuals have increased risk of serious Covid-19 disease and consequently increased risk of death. Despite vaccine effectiveness may be lower for these individuals, expected benefits from the vaccination are considered to be higher.</p>\n<p> </p>\n","path":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/who-should-not-get-vaccinated","langcode":"en"},"c0":{"title":"COVID – SPORT III Ski resorts","content":"<p>The Ministry of Industry and Trade has prepared a compensation program for ski resorts with regards to their seasonal opening regime i.e. they can only be open a few weeks / months a year.

The vaccine can be developed only after the particular virus can be analyzed. For those reasons, it is unbelievable that several safe and effective vaccines have been developed in a single year. Unfortunately, it is not possible neither in production nor logistically to make vaccines available for everyone. Production capacities are limited. This situation will improve and vaccines will be more accessible.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that it does not reach everyone, it is necessary to first vaccinate those on whom the virus has the greatest impact in order to return to normal, pre-pandemic life as quickly and smoothly as possible. With regard to the specificity of resources (availability of the vaccine over time, staff capacity, etc.), the prioritization of individual groups of persons to be vaccinated first is determined in order to immunize as soon as possible the part of the population whose worsening health conditions may overload the health system, or these are the people who die of coronavirus most often.</p>\n<p><strong>System prioritization takes into account 3 parameters:</strong></p>\n<p>- age </p>\n<p>- medical anamnesis,</p>\n<p>- occupation.</p>\n<p>Based on these parameters a number is assigned to the most threatened groups.

This recommendation also applies to the postponement of the administration of the second dose in case of illness after the first dose. Reinfection within 3 months after being ill with Covid-19 is unlikely according to available data. Therefore, if vaccine availability is limited, we recommend postponing vaccination of the first or second dose for 3 months after having Covid-19 or asymptomatic infection (after a positive test) after isolation. However, in the case of a high risk of infection, it is possible to vaccinate no earlier than 3 months after covid-19 disease. It is always necessary to assess the severity of the Covid-19 disease, adjustment of health and clinical condition at the time of vaccination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Progression of Covid-19 before the second dose</strong></p>\n<p>If a positive test for Covid-19 is detected between the first and second dose of vaccination, the second dose is postponed for at least 7 days after the detection of a positive test for Covid-19 in the asymptomatic course and at least for 14 days after the disease, respectively, in both cases after the end of isolation (according to the recommendations of the Czech Vaccination Society). The intervals between individual doses must be maintained.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Contact with a Covid-positive person</strong></p>\n<p>In persons quarantined due to contact with a Covid-19 positive person, vaccination can be started immediately after quarantine has ended (according to the recommendations of the Czech Vaccination Society). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Treatment with Covid-19 monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma</strong></p>\n<p>There are currently no data on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in subjects who have received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma for treatment. Based on the estimated half-life of these products and evidence that suggests that reinfection is unusual within 3 months of the previous infection, vaccination should be delayed for 3 months after receiving monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. The reason for postponing vaccination is to prevent possible interference of antibody treatment with the immune response elicited by the vaccine (according to the recommendations of the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Missing the interval between doses</strong></p>\n<p>The maximum interval between the first and second dose of the vaccine has not been established. If the second dose of vaccine is not given at the recommended interval according to the SPC of the vaccine, the first dose is counted and the second dose is given as soon as possible (as recommended by the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Shortened interval between doses</strong></p>\n<p>If given incorrectly 17 or 18 days after the first dose, it is not necessary to repeat the second dose. In case of incorrect administration earlier than 17 days after the first dose, the second dose is considered invalid and must be repeated 21 days after the incorrectly administered dose (according to the recommendation of the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Simultaneous application of other vaccines</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination when co-administering another vaccine, it is not recommended to co-administer with any other vaccines. The administration of another vaccine (live attenuated and non-live) is recommended at least 14 days after the application of the Covid-19 vaccine. If another vaccine is inadvertently administered within these 14 days, it is not necessary to repeat the dose of any of the vaccines (as recommended by the Czech Vaccination Society).</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n","path":"/situations/information-about-vaccine/specific-situations-during-vaccination","langcode":"en"},"ce":{"title":"From registration to vaccination","content":"<p>Vaccination will be voluntary and registration will take place through the Central Reservation System (CRS).</p>\n<p>Below you will briefly find out in points what will happen from the moment you register to the moment you are vaccinated.

Since 2003, however, some vaccines against diseases caused by animal coronaviruses have been produced, including those against avian infectious bronchitis, canine, and feline coronavirus disease. The objective of the previous projects (from 2005 and 2006), which focused on development of vaccines against viruses from the <em>Coronaviridae </em>family attacking humans, was to develop a vaccine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These vaccines had been tested on animals. Although their development had not been finished, experiences gained from it could be used in the development of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</p>\n<p>The urgency to create a vaccine against COVID-19 led to setting up accelerated harmonograms which let the common development timespan of a vaccine shrink to months.</p>\n<p>The fastest development of a vaccine so far - from picking the virus, in this case the mumps one, to the final approval - lasted 4 years. That vaccine had been developed in the sixties. But already at the beginning of December 2020, developers of several vaccines had announced excellent results of their big trials. And on December 2, 2020, the vaccine produced by the Pfizer big pharma and German bio-technological company BioNTech became the first fully tested and (emergency-use-)authorized vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Even with its development so accelerated, a vaccine has to succesfully pass the following series of clinical trials:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase I - </strong>the safety of the vaccine as well as its ability to trigger an immune response gets evaluated on a small group of people</p>\n<p><strong>Phase II - </strong>in this phase the effective dosis is determined, the vaccine is tested on a greater group of people now</p>\n<p><strong>Phase III -</strong> the sample group of people grows to thousands, the safety and efficacy of the vaccine is tested</p>\n<p>Currently almost 200 vaccines are tested, of which 154 are vaccine candidates in a preclinical stage, 21 in Phase I, 12 in Phase II, and 11 in Phase III. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna big trials had counted 44.000 and 30.000 volunteers, respectively. Half of them got a placebo - that is, compared to Phases III of other trials, significantly more. These numbers of volunteers participating are able to compensate the shortening of the monitoring period.</p>\n<p>The experiences from the COVID-19 vaccine development almost certainly will change the future of the vaccine-related science. They show how fast the vaccine development can advance when there is a real global threat and enough resources. It turned out that it is possible to significantly accelerate the development process of a vaccine without violating its safety at the same time.</p>\n<p><em>Original text author: prof.

Hundreds of volunteers in the Phase II as well as thousands in the Phase III got the vaccine administered since mid-2020 - with another thousands of vaccinated patients joining the crowd now.

The vaccine consists of an RNA section with a message inserted for a purpose of creation one of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein which is crucial for immune system reaction.</p>\n<p>mRNA does not interact with a nucleus (cell core) where our genome is located. The protein is produced from mRNA pattern in a cytoplasm, which is separated from the nucleus, and therefore also from our genome, by the membrane.

Prokázat takovou výjimku je vhodné zejména nájemní či kupní smlouvou k nemovitosti.</li>\n<li>\n<p>To se však nevztahuje na prohlídky bytů a nemovitostí. Takové prohlídky nemají výjimku ze zákazu opuštění okresu. Tyto činnosti lze realizovat i jinými prostředky, bez přímé osobní účasti.

Pandemie tvoří zcela neznámou situaci. Takové nepříjemné pocity, vyvolané zejména velkou nejistotou, jsou zcela normální a přirozené.</li>\n<li><strong>Udržujte vztahy a sociální kontakt tak, jak to teď jde</strong> Lidé přirozeně žijí ve vztazích – partnerských, rodinných, přátelských. Proto není divu, že nám karanténa a sociální izolace neprospívá. Jenže jsou to právě tato opatření, která jsou v boji s pandemií nejúčinnější. Pokud nežijete sami, pokuste se tento čas maximálně využít k péči o svoje vztahy. Koukněte se společně na film či si zahrajte společenskou hru. Ke komunikaci s ostatními využijte všechny způsoby komunikace na dálku – mobilní telefon, video hovory, sociální sítě atd. Pokud se cítíte osamělí, je možné, že se vám do kontaktu ani nechce, samota totiž krmí sama sebe. V takovém případě zkuste s tímto pocitem zabojovat a kontaktujte někoho ze svých blízkých, určitě vám to pomůže.</li>\n<li><strong>Držte režim a žijte co nejvíc „jako normálně“</strong> I pokud pracujete z domova, snažte se udržet si režim podobný tomu, jako byste do práce docházeli. Snažte se dodržovat pravidelné vstávání i pracovní dobu. Při rozplynutí dní do jakéhosi „vakua,“ je daleko větší pravděpodobnost výskytu úzkostných pocitů či výčitek. Navíc nám pravidelný řád dá pocit jistoty v jinak nejisté době. </li>\n<li><strong>Nežijte jen koronavirem</strong> I když je důležité informovat se o současné situaci, je rovněž důležité umět média včas vypnout. Přehlcení informacemi pak může vyvolat pocity úzkosti. Určete si čas, kdy budete číst zprávy, např. ráno a večer 30 minut.</li>\n<li><strong>Sportem ku (duševnímu) zdraví</strong> Pohyb hraje klíčovou roli v naší psychické pohodě. Zkuste se jít každý den na chvíli projít nebo si alespoň zacvičte doma, třeba podle některého <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG5CBmocpXM&amp;list=PLuhJ8-1PdCjx6I8bzA0ZfFJOHkcU0E2wG&amp;index=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">z videí Armády ČR</a><em>.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Nebojte se říct o pomoc </strong> Pokud cítíte, že na vás situace doléhá a vy byste se potřebovali někomu svěřit, řešit konkrétní problém nebo si jen s někým popovídat, neváhejte se obrátit na některou z linek pomoci, najdete je v sekci <a href=\"/situace/stres-zvladani-dopadu-pandemie/psychologicka-pomoc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stres a zvládání dopadů pandemie &gt; Psychologická pomoc.</a></li>\n</ol><p>Článek je zkrácenou verzí textu <a href=\"https://psychologie.cz/sest-kroku-dusevnimu-zdravi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">Šest kroků k duševnímu zdraví</a> od Nely G. Wurmové.<br />\n </p>\n","path":"/situace/stres-zvladani-dopadu-pandemie/dusevni-hygiena","langcode":"cs"},"ec":{"title":"Druhý stupeň","content":"<h2><strong>Pravidla a doporučení </strong></h2>\n<p>Na základě opatření vlády se osobní <strong>přítomnost žáků na výuce v základních školách zakazuje</strong>.

Dbejte proto pokynů zdravotníka, aby se zajistilo, že odběr proběhne v pořádku a zároveň to bude pro vás minimálně diskomfortní.</p>\n<p>Pro určení spolehlivosti a chybovosti antigenních testů se používají výpočty <strong>tzv. specificity a senzitivity</strong>.</p>\n<p>Senzitivita se měří poměrem pozitivně otestovaných antigenním testem proti všem nakaženým (včetně lidí kteří vyšli z antigenního testu negativně, i když referenční RT-PCR test vyšel pozitivně). Dle informace z tiskové konference 26.11. 2020 (Státní zdravotní ústav – Ostrava) mají antigenní testy dovážené do ČR senzitivitu v rozmezí 81 % až 98 %. To znamená že <strong>negativní výsledek</strong> z antigenního testování <strong>nemusí znamenat, že nejste nakažen s takovou spolehlivostí, jako PCR test.</strong></p>\n<p>Specificita se měří poměrem negativně otestovaných antigenním testem proti všem nenakaženým (včetně lidí, kteří vyšli z antigenního testu pozitivně, i když referenční RT-PCR test vyšel negativně). Antigenní testy obecně mají vysokou míru specificity. To znamená že člověk, kterému <strong>vyšel pozitivně antigenní test je s vysokou mírou pravděpodobnosti nakažen</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Může mi být otestování antigenním testem odmítnuto?</h2>\n<p>Ano, vyšetření se neprovádí<strong> u osob, které absolvovaly</strong> z důvodu onemocnění COVID-19 <strong><a href=\"/situace/onemocneni-obecne-o-opatrenich/izolace\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Izolace\">izolaci</a> </strong>minimálně v rozsahu podle platného mimořádného opatření Ministerstva zdravotnictví a zároveň u nich <strong>neuplynulo více než 90 dnů </strong>od prvního RT-PCR testu s pozitivním výsledkem.

Výzkum vakcín proti covid-19 se zaměřuje na vyvolání odpovědi na část nebo celý protein na povrchu koronaviru (tzv. spike protein neboli protein S), který je pro tento virus jedinečný. Po očkování vakcínou se u dané osoby vyvolá imunitní odpověď. Jestliže se tato osoba později virem nakazí, imunitní systém virus rozpozná a protože již bude připraven proti němu bojovat, danou osobu před onemocněním COVID-19 ochrání.</p>\n<p>Vzhledem k tomu, že se jedná o zcela nový virus, neexistují v současné době dostatečné poznatky o tom, jak dlouho po očkování se imunita navozená vakcínou zachová, nebo zda bude potřeba pravidelného přeočkování. Údaje ze studií imunogenicity a účinnosti v dlouhodobém měřítku poslouží jako východisko pro budoucí strategie očkování. </p>\n<h2><strong>Ochrana při mutaci viru:</strong></h2>\n<p>Viry obvykle mutují (mění se jejich genetický materiál); u různých virů toto probíhá různě rychle, přičemž mutace nemusejí nezbytně ovlivnit to, jak bude vakcína proti viru účinkovat. Některé vakcíny proti virovým onemocněním si zachovávají účinnost po mnoho let poté, kdy byly vyvinuty, a poskytují dlouhodobou ochranu. Tak je tomu např. u vakcíny proti spalničkám nebo příušnicím. Na druhou stranu u takových nemocí, jako je chřipka, se kmeny virů mění tak často a v takovém rozsahu, že složení vakcíny se musí upravovat každoročně, aby bylo účinné.</p>\n<p>Vědecká obec a regulační orgány sledují, zda se koronavirus Sars-CoV-2 bude v průběhu času měnit, a pokud ano, zda vakcína může lidi ochránit před nákazou novými variantami.</p>\n<h2><strong>Jak vám bude po očkování a vedlejší účinky vakcíny:</strong></h2>\n<p>Po očkování se může objevit bolest hlavy, únava nebo například bolest svalů. Není se čeho bát, nejedná se o příznaky nemoci. Očkováním se naše tělo a imunitní systém učí, jak bojovat s nemocí, proti které vakcína chrání. Tohle učení s sebou přináší i výše zmíněné nepříjemnosti.</p>\n<p>Přibližně každý desátý člověk má po aplikaci vakcíny reakci jako je <strong>zčervenání nebo bolestivost v</strong> <strong>místě vpichu, bolest svalů, únavu, zvýšenou teplotu nebo vyrážku</strong>.

Jde tedy zejména o velká zdravotnická zařízení, která mají potřebné technické vybavení. DOČM zabezpečují i další distribuci očkovacích látek do nemocničních lékáren a zdravotních ústavů. DOČM povinně zřizuje minimálně jeden mobilní očkovací tým (OČT) pro potřeby příslušného kraje.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Očkovací místa (OČM)</strong><br />\nOčkovacím místem je určené zdravotnické zařízení poskytovatele zdravotních služeb, který provádí očkování proti covid-19, kromě ordinací praktických lékařů a pediatrů. Jeden poskytovatel zdravotních služeb může zřizovat více očkovacích míst na různých adresách. Pokud je v jednom očkovacím místě zřízeno více ordinací, kde je prováděno očkování, označují se jako očkovací stanice. OČM může zřizovat mobilní OČT pro potřeby příslušného kraje.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Velkokapacitní očkovací místa (VOČM)</strong><br />\nSpeciální typ očkovacího místa mimo běžné prostory zdravotnického zařízení, které je uzpůsobené pro zajištění očkování velkého počtu obyvatel.

Občani se skrz něj budou registrovat a bude jim přidělen termín očkování. Využívat bude zkušenosti se systémem, který slouží k plošnému antigennímu testování. Centrální rezervační systém (CRS) svými komponentami plní zejména roli registrace a rezervace osob pro očkování a plně tak eviduje průchod osoby očkovacím procesem. Systém je navržen pro podporu prioritizace. Je navržen tak, aby registraci a rezervaci seniorů, kteří neovládají práci s internetem, mohli asistenčně provádět rodinní příslušníci, sociální pracovníci, praktičtí lékaři i pracovníci linky podpory 1221. Systém je navázán na Informační systém infekčních nemocní (ISIN) a jeho modul Očkování (ISIN-OČKO).</p>\n<h2>Jak se registrovat a získat tak termín očkování?</h2>\n<p>Centrální registrační systém byl spuštěn 15. 1. 2021, kdy začala registrace osob 80+.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Musíte se zaregistrovat</strong> na webu <a href=\"https://crs.mzcr.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">crs.mzcr.cz</a>, nebo <a href=\"https://registrace.mzcr.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">registrace.mzcr.cz</a> - funkční jsou oba odkazy, oba vás dovedou na online registrační formulář pro občany, indikující váš zájem a souhlas s očkováním. Vyplníte atributy pro prioritizaci (zařazení občana do skupiny), tzn. informace o sobě.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Proběhne prioritizace</strong>- je vypočteno bodové skóre, které spolu s plánem dodávek vakcín určuje, kdy budete vyzváni k rezervaci konkrétního termínu. Pokud to kapacita dovolí, dostanete termín ihned. Může se ale stát, že z kapacitních důvodů ihned nedostanete přidělený termín. Jakmile to kapacita dovolí, bude vám zaslán přidělený termín.

Pro úspěch tohoto konceptu bude nezbytné vést efektivní komunikační kampaň. Princip registrací předpokládá postupné uvolňování rezervací v CRS pro prioritní skupiny osob v návaznosti na plán dodávek vakcín, které se budou doplňovat například z neprioritní skupiny dle registrací, které budou k dispozici. Neobsazená místa se doplní z dalších registrací s nižším bodovým skóre. Algoritmizace je vytvářena na základě kapacity a dodávek.</p>\n<h2>Co všechno Centrální rezervační systém (CRS) umí?</h2>\n<p>CRS není jen standardní rezervační systém, k použití pro očkování. Bude zabezpečovat i nestandardní průběhy rezervací (dva termíny v různých intervalech dle typu vakcíny), nutno zajistit „vždy volný druhý termín“. Obsahuje také parametrizovatelný kalkulátor prioritizace. Předkládá se průběžná úprava parametrů prioritizace na základě stavu dodávek vakcín, zájmu občanů o očkování a vytížení očkovacích míst. CRS bude stejný pro celou ČR. Napojení na ISIN je pak důležité např. k vystavování a ověření potvrzení o provedeném očkování, včetně podpory mobilních zařízení a kompatibility se standardy EU a WHO, nebo k vedení elektronického očkovacího průkazu občana.</p>\n<p>Všechny druhy očkovacích míst musí používat CRS (jedinou výjimku budou mít praktičtí lékaři, až se do očkování zapojí). CRS zpracovává osobní údaje zájemců o očkování na základě čl. 6 odst. 1 písm. e) a čl. 9 odst. 2 písm. i) GDPR jako nezbytné pro splnění úkolu prováděného ve veřejném zájmu, kterým je jako správce pověřeno Ministerstvo zdravotnictví v oblasti veřejného zdraví, při ochraně před vážným zdravotními hrozbami. Zájemci o očkování budou informování o zpracování jejich osobních údajů v rámci vyplňovaného formuláře. Zpracování osobních údajů bude prováděno v souladu s nařízením GDPR.</p>\n<p>Z hlediska charakteru procesu a nutnosti řízení kapacit ve vazbě na dodávky očkovacích látek musí být systém koncipován na principech centrální registrace a prioritizace, stejně jako centrální správy rezervací termínů. Nelze tedy využít existující rezervační systémy poskytovatelů zdravotních služeb, protože není mechanismus, jak do nich předat detailní informace o aktuálně prioritní skupině osob. Formulář je počáteční bod pro vstup do procesu očkování. Poskytuje přístup k registraci na očkování z jednoho místa (formulář/web MZ). Vyplněním formuláře vyjadřuje osoba svůj zájem o provedení očkování a poskytuje o své osobě údaje, které jsou pro provedení nezbytné.</p>\n","path":"/situace/registrace-na-ockovani/centralni-rezervacni-system","langcode":"cs"},"mj":{"title":"Kdo by se neměl nechat očkovat?","content":"<p>I když se ve vzácných případech může stát, že má vakcína <a href=\"/situace/informace-o-vakcine/postup-pri-vyskytu-nezadouci-reakce-po-ockovani\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Postup při výskytu nežádoucí reakce po očkování\">nežádoucí účinky</a>, stále je jejich propuknutí mnohem méně pravděpodobné, než že se nemocí nakazíte.

Moderna pak 18 let.</p>\n<p><strong>OSOBY S ALERGICKÝM ONEMOCNĚNÍM</strong></p>\n<p>V průběhu používání mRNA vakcíny v běžné praxi, mimo klinické studie, byly hlášeny u některých očkovaných osob anafylaktické reakce po očkování. Riziko anafylaktické reakce po mRNA vakcínách se pohybuje v řádu přibližně 1 : 100 tisícům až 1 : 400 tisícům podaných dávek. Je tedy vyšší než po rutinních vakcínách, ale stále velmi nízké. K převážné většině anafylaktických reakcí dochází během 15 minut po očkování a převážná<br />\nvětšina osob s anafylaxí měla v anamnéze alergie nebo alergické reakce, včetně reakcí anafylaktických. Výskyt závažné alergické reakce (anafylaxe) na jakoukoli jinou vakcínu nebo injekční terapii (např. intramuskulární, intravenózní nebo subkutánní) v minulosti, musí vést k opatrnosti při očkování, ale není kontraindikací očkování pro mRNA vakcíny. Těmto osobám může být mRNA vakcína aplikována, ale měly by být poučeny o možném riziku rozvoje závažné alergické reakce a mělo by být porovnáno riziko reakce s přínosem očkování. Osoby s bezprostřední alergickou reakcí po první dávce vakcíny by neměly být očkované druhou dávkou. Za bezprostřední alergickou reakci jsou považovány příznaky hypersenzitivity - anafylaxe, urticaria, angioedém, respirační tíseň (pískoty nebo stridor) - objevující se během hodin po aplikaci vakcíny.</p>\n<p>mRNA vakcíny jsou kontraindikované také u osob, které mají v anamnéze bezprostřední alergickou reakci po jakékoli složce vakcíny. Obě mRNA vakcíny obsahují velmi málo alergenních složek a v úvahu přichází především polyetylenglykol (PEG) a příbuzné molekuly. Polyetylenglykol není součástí žádné jiné registrované vakcíny. Kontraindikací je také bezprostřední alergická reakce na příbuznou molekulu polysorbát, která se využívá ve vakcínách jako stabilizátor. Alergie na tyto látky jsou velmi vzácné. Kontaktní alergie, alergie na potraviny, pylové alergie ani alergie na latex nejsou kontraindikací očkování. Očkující zdravotnická zařízení musí být vybavena k léčbě anafylaktické reakce. Všichni pracovníci očkovacího centra musí být proškoleni k rozeznání anafylaktické reakce a k jejímu řešení a toto proškolení musí být dokumentováno. Očkující zdravotnické zařízení musí být vybaveno minimálně adrenalinem, tonometrem a fonendoskopem. Zařízení může být vybaveno i dalšími prostředky ke zvládnutí anafylaktické reakce. Zařízení musí mít písemný plán k řešení anafylaktické reakce a následné péče. Všichni očkovaní s bezprostřední alergickou reakcí na jakoukoli látku v anamnéze musí být sledováni ve zdravotnickém zařízení 30 minut po aplikaci očkovací látky, v ostatních případech je minimální dobou 15 minut.</p>\n<p><strong>OSOBY S AUTOIMUNITNÍM ONEMOCNĚNÍM</strong></p>\n<p>V současné době nejsou k dispozici žádné údaje o bezpečnosti a účinnosti vakcín proti nemoci covid-19 u osob s autoimunitními chorobami, ačkoliv tyto osoby byly způsobilé pro zařazení do klinických studií. U účastníků klinických studií, kteří dostali mRNA vakcínu, nebyl ve srovnání s placebem pozorován žádný rozdíl ve výskytu příznaků shodných s autoimunitními stavy nebo zánětlivými poruchami mezi očkovanými osobami a kontrolní skupinou osob s podaným placebem. Osoby s autoimunitními chorobami, které nemají žádné kontraindikace k očkování, mohou být očkované.</p>\n<p><strong>TĚHOTNÉ ŽENY</strong></p>\n<p>Těhotné ženy mají proti netěhotným ženám stejného věku zvýšené riziko závažného průběhu onemocnění covid-19. Covid-19 může zvyšovat riziko předčasného porodu. Těhotenství bylo vylučujícím kritériem pro zařazení do studií mRNA vakcín. Dostupná data neumožňují posoudit účinnost a bezpečnost mRNA vakcín v graviditě. Vakcíny neobsahují živý virus, mRNA nevstupuje do jádra buňky a je rychle degradována. Animální studie vývojové a reprodukční toxikologie neprokázaly žádný škodlivý vliv na těhotenství. U žen, které otěhotněly v průběhu klinických studií, se neobjevily žádné bezpečnostní signály. U těhotných žen s dalším zdravotním nebo profesním rizikem by se k očkování mělo přistupovat po individuálním zvážení prospěchu a rizika vakcíny.</p>\n<p><strong>KOJÍCÍ ŽENY</strong></p>\n<p>Pro kojící ženy platí podobná fakta jako pro ženy gravidní. Riziko závažného průběhu nemoci covid-19 není pro kojící ženu zvýšené. Kojení bylo vylučujícím kritériem pro zařazení do studií mRNA vakcín. Dostupná data neumožňují posoudit účinnost a bezpečnost mRNA vakcín pro kojící ženu ani pro její kojené dítě. U kojících žen s dalším zdravotním nebo profesním rizikem by se k očkování mělo přistupovat po individuálním zvážení prospěchu a rizika vakcíny. Očkování není důvodem pro přerušení kojení.</p>\n<p><strong>OSOBY S KOMODBIDITAMI</strong><br />\nNěkterá chronická onemocnění zvyšují riziko závažného průběhu nemoci covid-19 a úmrtí. Ve studiích byla prokázána bezpečnost i účinnost vakcín pro osoby s těmito onemocněními Srovnatelná s bezpečností a účinností pro zdravé osoby. K těmto chronickým onemocněním patří hypertenze, diabetes mellitus, astma, plicní, jaterní a renální onemocnění a chronické (stabilizované a dobře kontrolované) infekce viry HIV, HCV a HBV. Vakcinace se doporučuje osobám s chronickými onemocněními. </p>\n<p><strong>OSOBY S IMUNODEFICITY</strong><br />\nDoporučujeme očkování všem imunokompromitovaným osobám, včetně osob s onkologickými onemocněními a osob na imunosupresivní terapii. Tyto osoby mají zvýšené riziko komplikovaného průběhu nemoci covid-19 včetně zvýšeného rizika úmrtí a i když u nich může být účinnost vakcinace snížená, předpokládaný prospěch vakcinace  převyšuje její možná rizika.</p>\n","path":"/situace/informace-o-vakcine/kdo-se-nemel-nechat-ockovat","langcode":"cs"},"mk":{"title":"COVID – SPORT III Lyžařská střediska","content":"<p>MPO připravilo pro skiareály kompenzační program, který zohledňuje jejich specifický provoz, tzn. mohou být otevřeny jen pár týdnů/měsíců v roce.

Bohužel ale není výrobně ani logisticky možné, aby byla hned v počátku očkování vakcína dostupná všem. Výrobní kapacity firem jsou omezené. Tato situace se bude v čase lepšit, vakcín bude přibývat.

Toto doporučení platí i pro odložení aplikace druhé dávky v případě prodělání onemocnění po první dávce. Reinfekce během 3 měsíců po infekci je podle dostupných údajů málo pravděpodobná. Z tohoto důvodu doporučujeme při omezené dostupnosti očkovací látky odložit očkování první nebo druhé dávky o 3 měsíce po prodělaném onemocnění Covid-19 nebo bezpříznakové infekci (po pozitivním testu), po ukončení izolace. V případě vysokého rizika nákazy je však možné očkovat dříve než za 3 měsíce po prodělané nemoci covid-19.U každého očkovaného je vždy nezbytné individuálně posoudit závažnost proběhlého onemocnění covid-19, úpravu zdravotního stavu a klinický stav v době očkování.</p>\n<p><strong>Prodělání onemocnění covid-19 před aplikací druhé dávky </strong></p>\n<p>Při zjištění pozitivního testu na covid-19 mezi první a druhou dávkou očkování, se druhá dávka se odloží se na termín nejdříve za 7 dnů po zjištění pozitivního testu na covid-19 při asymptomatickém průběhu a nejdříve za 14 dnů po prodělaném onemocnění, resp. v obou případech po ukončení izolace (dle doporučení České vakcinologické společnosti).

Na základě odhadovaného poločasu těchto přípravků a poznatků, které naznačují, že reinfekce je neobvyklá během 3 měsíců po předchozí infekci, by mělo být očkování odloženo o 3 měsíce po aplikaci monoklonálních protilátek nebo rekonvalescentní plazmy.

Od roku 2003 však byly vyrobeny vakcíny proti několika chorobám zvířat způsobeným koronaviry, včetně infekčního viru bronchitidy u ptáků, psího koronaviru a kočičího koronaviru. Předchozí projekty (v letech 2005 a 2006) zaměřené na vývoj vakcín proti virům z čeledi Coronaviridae, které působí na člověka, byly zaměřeny na těžký akutní respirační syndrom (SARS) a respirační syndrom na Středním východě (MERS). Vakcíny proti SARS a MERS byly testovány na zvířatech.
